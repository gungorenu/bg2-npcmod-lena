@0    = ~Lena Romance, BG2 NPC Mod~
@1    = ~tempest~
@2    = ~Tempest~
@3    = ~TEMPEST: Tempests are mobile and agility based warriors, excel at hit and run tactics. They are highly deadly at close combat and with their fast movement they can still maintain their effectiveness at ranged distances.

Due to focus on their mobility, 2 handed weapons like halberds or two-handed swords are not preferred by Tempests. Shields also block free movement although tempests with shields exist.

Tempests can be confused with scouts. Scouts only observe the area, avoiding any kind of detection and enemy resistance. Tempests are opposite; they don't focus on stealth but instead offensive force and quick neutralization abilities.

Advantages:
  - -2 bonus to speed factor at 1st level, gain -1 additional bonus to speed factor every 6 level
  - May use Cyclone ability one time per day (starting with 1 use at 1st level), gain additional use per day every 5 level. Cyclone lasts for 1 turn.
    Free Action, +1 AC, an extra attack, +3 movement rate
    Tempest becomes winded after Cyclone ends for 5 rounds and cannot use Haste or Cyclone during this duration (-2 AC, -2 movement rate, -2 THAC0).
    Tempest becomes Tireless at 16th level, does not become winded after Cyclone.
  - May use Thunderdash ability one time per day at 4th level, gain additional use per day every 4 level. Tempest moves in a flash to target destination more like a teleportation.
  - Waves of Exhaustion: starting from 11th level, during Cyclone, every enemy within 15ft should save vs Breath or exhausted (-2 AC, -2 THAC0, halved movement speed, -4 penalty to casting speed and attack speed, attack per round reduced by 1). Fatigue lasts for 1 round if away from Tempest. If targets stay close to Tempest, then save vs Breath is required every round.
  - Clairvoyance: starting from 16th level, during Cyclone, a Tempest can sense invisible creatures. During this duration Tempest becomes immune to blindness and backstab.

Disadvantages:
  -  penalty to Strength -2
  -  can only specialize with a ranged weapon
  -  cannot use 2 handed weapons
  -  can only use up to Studded Leather
  -  cannot dual class

This red armor is too thin, it can be confused with a clothing.  You have not seen Lena removing this armor.

Soon she started going on raider quests, infiltrating enemy lines, kill target and run away quests.  With her successes she became a captain for her squad but her last mission was a failure; she was captured by enemy.  With the first solid chance, she escaped and you met her in Planar Sphere. ~

@681   = ~No, I just want to learn it, nothing will change.~
@682   = ~I was not. Are you happy now? You learnt the truth so leave me alone.~
@683   = ~I don't believe you. Show some respect to my life, <CHARNAME>. Don't you ever come to me for such ridiculous questions.~
@684   = ~Maybe, can't promise though.~
@685   = ~I don't believe you. Show some respect to my life, <CHARNAME>. Don't you ever come to me for such ridiculous questions.~
@686   = ~Perhaps it is better if I don't poke into your past. Sorry for this, Lena.~
@687   = ~Yes, that is better. Thanks for your respect to my life, <CHARNAME>.~
@688   = ~What?... What the hell is wrong with you <CHARNAME>?~
@689   = ~Sorry but I was just curious~
@690   = ~Show some respect to my life, <CHARNAME>. Don't you ever come to me for such ridiculous questions.~

@693   = ~Perhaps it is better if I don't poke into your past. Sorry for this, Lena.~
@694   = ~Of course it is better for your health. Don't you ever come to me for such ridiculous questions.~
@695   = ~Do you remember your father?~
@696   = ~No, I have not seen him either. Any man I saw around my mother could be my real father. My mother had associations with slavery and my father was probably a pleasure slave for her. I can be considered a mistake or amusement for my mother.~
@697   = ~Do you feel any regrets about your life?~
@698   = ~Of course, there are many things I want to change about my life but most of them long ago forgotten; I can't change what is done. There is no reason to dwell on them anymore.~
@699   = ~What is your favorite color?~
@700   = ~Probably you think it is red but no; I like white more. It is combination of all other colors and it represent my life goal.~
@701   = ~Do you have any very real nightmares?~
@702   = ~When I was young, I had many nightmares. Some dark shapes, shadows were torturing, beating and killing me in my dreams. With years passed, they are gone now. From time to time still they remind me old days in my dreams but very very rare.~
@703   = ~If I ever wanted me to buy you a gift, what would you expect most?~
@704   = ~I already told you; I want a mephit as a pet. Buy an intelligent one for me.~
@705   = ~Hmm, let me think. A better armor is always welcome but it has to be far better than mine so you don't have a high chance on that. My sword is also real good quality. I don't value small trinkets like other weaklings do. But of course you can give me a better sturdy and lightweight metal plated boots to kick butt.~
@706   = ~(flirt)~
@707   = ~(Lena realizes your gaze and questions your presence with her eyes)~
@708   = ~(hold her hand)~
@709   = ~(She lets you hold her hand without any hassle. You and Lena walk together for a few steps but suddenly she stabs her finger nails to your hand.)~
@710   = ~I am not your wife, <CHARNAME>; go away and find someone else.~
@711   = ~(As soon as you stretch your hand to hold hers, she takes her both hands and puts her arms on her chest.) ~
@712   = ~Stop this ridiculous nonsense, <CHARNAME>.~
@713   = ~(She lets you hold her hand and you walk together. Soon she turns to you, taking her hand back.)~
@714   = ~I still don't understand what you feel when you hold my hand. All I feel is some flesh, nothing else.~
@715   = ~(She pushes your hand away) Wash your hands first, <CHARNAME>. Can't you see the dirt and mud on that? Pay attention to your personal hygiene.~
@716   = ~(With quick reflex she forces your fingers backwards, giving you a nasty pain but she quickly releases you) Oh, I did not know it was you, my reflexes did that.~
@717   = ~(She takes your hand again but holds tight now) Better now?~
@718   = ~(She lets you hold her hand for a moment but takes back) We are not in private, <CHARNAME>; others will see.~
@719   = ~(smile at her)~
@720   = ~What is so funny about me? Tell and we can laugh together.~
@721   = ~(She notices your smile but gives you a sullen face with no expression, staring at you. After a few seconds she turns away without any word.)~
@722   = ~You look like a clown; cease that behavior.~
@723   = ~(She plays with your lips with her hands making a large smile or a duck like lips, stretching your cheeks) Now better, no, this is better, hmm, maybe like this...~
@724   = ~(She gives you back the prettiest smile you have never seen from her before but very shortly she takes it back again) That's enough for today.~
@725   = ~I wish I could be care free like you, <CHARNAME> but no, there is always something to improve and that thing eats my mind continuously. Sorry, my head is away right now.~
@726   = ~(pull her tail)~
@727   = ~(As soon as you touch her tail, she jumps and turns her face towards you) Don't tell me you were playing with that. I warn you <CHARNAME>, for the first and last time. I lose my control when someone physically touches it or uses it in a sentence. Stay away from that, in any way you can interact, understood?~
@728   = ~(With an unbelievable agility, she takes a dagger from her waist back and swings towards your hand. There is a small cut on your hand and it could be worse if your reflexes were slower.) I warned you <CHARNAME>. Don't test my patience, soon you will lose me over that useless thing.~
@729   = ~(play with her hair)~
@730   = ~(Her hair is neither short nor long, does not even fall under her neck yet shoulder. It is obvious Lena cares for her hair but she does not use any hairclip or make a ponytail, all hair falls straight. For a moment you make eye contact with Lena.) ~
@731   = ~Are you done dirtying my hair with your unwashed hands? (she takes your hand away) Damn, now I have to wash again.~
@732   = ~(She leans back trying to dodge your hand) Leave my hair alone <CHARNAME>, you are not bald, play with yours.~
@733   = ~(With her unintentional movement and your clumsy holding makes you pull her hair for a second. It was a mistake but the pull was a bit painful) Ouch, get your hands off me, <CHARNAME> (She holds her head).~
@734   = ~Hey, what are you... Oh, nevermind, I thought you were holding some scissors. ~
@735   = ~(She le's you play with her hair for some time, mostly watching your movements with her eyes only.) Enough, stop playing with my hair and show interest in me instead.~
@736   = ~If you are curious, my hair is natural red, it is no dye. (closes to you and whispers) Which makes me a sexy attractive tiefling, don't you think?~
@737   = ~(watch her thighs from back)~
@738   = ~(You fall back in party just to watch her from behind. Her movement slowly hypnotizes you, giving a chill within ever few steps, seducing more and more. Suddenly she turns back and catches your stare. She does not say a word as you continue walking like nothing happened. After you pass her with a smile, she follows you in close distance.) ~
@739   = ~(She moves her tail very frequently, disturbing your sight and view. Soon you give up and walk passing her. You give a quick stare at her face, for a moment you catch a glimpse of smile on her lips.)~
@740   = ~(As soon as you fall behind her she stops and waits, facing you) Don't fall back, <CHARNAME>. You are supposed to be our leader, not butt peeper.~
@741   = ~(She turns suddenly and catches your stare.) Today, I am in the good mood so I will be a good tiefling and let you stare wherever you wish. You will never have a chance for something physical anyway.~
@742   = ~(You fall back with the excuse of tightening your boots and follow Lena from behind. Seconds later she slows and let you catch her. She starts walking next to you now) If you missed me so much why don't we do something "together" tonight instead of "alone"?~
@743   = ~(While you are enjoying your view, you stumble and fall to ground due to a small boulder. Quickly you stand up like nothing happened but you see Lena giggling.) Men never change and you, <CHARNAME>, proved it.~
@744   = ~(fondle her thighs)~
@745   = ~(You plan everything like an accident, while passing, your hand will touch her thighs accidently. You fall back first and move forward faster than her, you succeed in slapping her thighs. Before you get a chance to get away from her, you feel a slashing pain on back of your legs.) Never do this again <CHARNAME>, never...~
@746   = ~(This plan is a suicide but a more direct one, you decide to perform openly exactly what you want to do.)~
@747   = ~Hey Lena, stop for a moment please. I want to try something on you.~
@748   = ~Alright, make it quick, <CHARNAME>. I am not in the mood for your nonsense.~
@749   = ~(fondle her thighs in front of her openly) I gladly accept my punishment now.~
@750   = ~How dare... Wait, were you planning this whole day? That is why you were thoughtful, I see... Idiot, you could not find another way and decide to do openly, hah.~
@751   = ~Your bravery and idiocy exceed everything in all planes, <CHARNAME>. Hmm, let's consider your punishment postponed for later, in the mean time I will think of something for you.~
@752   = ~(give up your plan) Nevermind Lena, let's move on.~
@753   = ~(She is not angry or does not have her sullen face today. You decide on a kind way to perform your action.)~
@754   = ~Hey, Lena will you allow me fondle your thighs once please?~
@755   = ~No.~
@756   = ~Please...~
@757   = ~I beg you...~
@758   = ~This is an order...~
@759   = ~Ok, I give up.~
@760   = ~(You are about to give a break from walking so you think of putting your hand where Lena is about to sit. You sit onto a boulder while she is standing, looking around to find a place to sit. You will put your hand at the final moment where she sits. You call Lena to sit next to you, she comes and sits...)~
@761   = ~(But no, she puts her left leg first then sits over her leg. Her boot's metal plates pierce your hand.) That is what happens if you ploy over me. (She presses more to make you suffer more.)~
@762   = ~(You both are away from the group walking from behind so none can see you. You walk next to Lena and fondle her thighs with your hand expecting no resistance from Lena.)~
@763   = ~(Unlike your expectation she quickly punches your pelvis with her elbow, raising a hell of pain.) Oh, sorry, my elbow moved out of my control.~
@764   = ~(After a long thinking, you make an excellent plan. You will walk backwards your hands at your back as if checking for something away and fondle her while she is standing there, a perfect accident.)~
@765   = ~(You perform your plan with success and a good feeling of her thighs. As you turn back Lena to apologize as if it was an accident, she puts her finger on your mouth.) I know how it happened, will you lie to me like other times?~
@766   = ~I will let this pass if you promise yourself to me tonight. You are not the only one who enjoys squeezes.~
@767   = ~Lena, it does not work anymore; we are not meant for each other. Sorry, I could not think of a less painful way to express myself. I hope you understand.~
@768   = ~I ...see. If you have made your mind already, there is nothing to do then. Thanks for your honesty; you are not playing with me at least. ~
@769   = ~I don't know how you interpret my actions and talking, Lena, but please do not think highly of them. I see you as a close friend, nothing more.~
@770   = ~Don't worry, I don't feel anything special for you anyway.~
@771   = ~(leave her alone)~
@772   = ~Wait for a second Lena...~
@773   = ~What is it?~
@774   = ~(Adalon's powerful magic worked like a charm but her traits are much more glittering now. Her darkish black skin with white hair made her look like a drow goddess. Her cruelness and sadistic behaviors match better now.)~
@775   = ~(Maybe it was best if she was a Drow always. She could even lead armies of drow against the others with better success. The stories of drow priestess' sexual pleasures comes to your mind and you feel like hypnotized by her beauty.)~
@776   = ~Why are you looking like that, <CHARNAME>? Is there something funny?~
@777   = ~Nothing, just unused to your drow view.~
@778   = ~Hmpf (moving her hands on her skin seductively) maybe I will enjoy more in this body.~
@779   = ~You look like a goddess as a drow Lena.~
@780   = ~Turn your eyes away from me, <CHARNAME>. I did not want to be a drow in the first place.~
@781   = ~Why are you asking? You will ask some petty action again, won't you?~

@801   = ~I watched your moves, <CHARNAME>. I still observe every step you make. As a <PRO_RACE> you have an intriguing life and destiny.~
@802   = ~We have not talked about what you are really trying to do. Of course your task lying ahead is a small step in your bigger scheme. I ask you about the bigger scheme you are playing. What are you really trying to do?~
@803   = ~I have not decided on any big scheme you talk about.~
@804   = ~You are a bhaalspawn, <CHARNAME> and you know the prophecy. I heard about this prophecy of reviving Bhaal long ago from an old priest. You fit the conditions of the chosen one but still you have to take the course towards the end to fulfill the prophecy.~
@805   = ~You answered my question ignoring these. Do you ever think that you are the one in the prophecy?~
@806   = ~I don't believe in prophecy and fate mentioned by ramblings of some elder. I'd like to choose my own way of living.~
@807   = ~Here is something we share common. The free will and freedom of actions are the actual purpose for our main struggle in life.~
@808   = ~It is good to see you are not like other religious lunatics who are determined to revive their now resting dead god.~
@809   = ~Do you believe in the fate? Do you think I am the one described in prophecy?~
@810   = ~No but in general all prophecies have some truth in them. If someone plays the role prophecy defines then prophecy comes true. But reversely if no one plays the role then it is just some rambling.~
@811   = ~If you increase the number of bhaalspawns then the chance of prophecy becoming truth increases but never becomes truth or fact. That is why I hate religious lunatics; all they do is to manipulate someone they find who can play the role in prophecy. In the end they only cause the chosen one to perish for no meaningful reason.~
@812   = ~What do you think about our meeting?~
@813   = ~Mere coincidence. If you were a few months earlier, you would not find me there. I don't believe in fate and if something happens beyond your control then it is coincidence, not fate.~
@814   = ~Although I have not met many demons besides, you don't talk like a demon.~
@815   = ~First of all I am a tiefling, not a demon; there is a difference between them. So you expected me to speak without thinking, insulting and threatening everyone, bashing any obstacle on first contact? Meh, you don't know anything about demons. ~
@816   = ~(after a short silence) Come to think of it, I take the "insulting and threatening part" back, I still behave such. Sorry for disappointing you if I did not only talk about chaos and destruction. These are aspects of lower unintelligent demons and mindless peons.~
@817   = ~By the way don't make an habit of changing topics, we were talking about fate and now I find myself trying to explain the difference between a demon and tiefling.~
@818   = ~I am tired of talking, maybe later we can continue after a rest.~
@819   = ~Maybe. I once knew another who thought he was the one. Things did not go well for him and he lies dead now.~
@820   = ~Someone close to you he was, I guess. At least you learned a lesson from his death, right? None of the prophecies are facts unless someone plays them. Of course don't forget the success chance of the things that have to be done in the prophecies.~
@821   = ~What would you do if let's say you found Imoen dead or the mage Irenicus becomes unreachable for you? Will you call this fate? ~
@822   = ~I don't like to think of such things. Learning something that would make your all efforts and maybe whole life meaningless is not something pleasant anyone would like to hear.~
@823   = ~This is life, be prepared for such things. Sometimes you succeed, sometimes fail.~
@824   = ~Would you call the end you described fate?~
@825   = ~No, it is just failure of someone's goal. You don't have to name it as fate. You worked hard, lost others dear to you, skipped other opportunities and in the end you still fail. You could become powerful as a god but still Imoen could be dead at the next moment you lost her for example.~
@826   = ~Fate is something one would blame for their own failures and the life's harnesses’. Also keep in mind, people call it fate when they fail but they don't mention it when they succeed.~
@827   = ~We can't call this fate. This is success or failure, in your example failure, of your goals.~
@828   = ~Exactly, you worked hard, lost others dear to you, skipped other opportunities and in the end you still fail. You could become powerful as a god but still Imoen could be dead at the next moment you lost her for example.~
@829   = ~Would you try it? I mean make the efforts like what I do?~
@830   = ~I don't value "family" like you do. I would not risk my neck for my sister if I had one. I am not after revenge either; even I have reason to have it but still don't feel the need of it. I try to think of my options and decide what to do after thinking about them deeply.~
@831   = ~Living to making these efforts is meaningless for me. My life is not worth for those but things always change even if they are very stable or hard to change.~
@832   = ~Yes, this is called fate. You take the course but cannot succeed. The end is inevitable in case of failure.~
@833   = ~If you knew Imoen will be dead by the time you reach her, would you again try the same? You would. If the wisest says Irenicus is too powerful for you and you will perish if you meet him, would you still try to find him? You would. ~
@834   = ~Even knowing the future would not stop you giving efforts for your goal because you don't want to believe in failure. You would take your chances to succeed. This is completely ignoring fate, in other words not believing it.~
@835   = ~You are talking about knowing the future which has nothing to do with fate.~
@836   = ~It does. Nevermind, I think I cannot explain you there is no difference between knowing the future and fate.~
@837   = ~I believe in fate, yes, but I have no ambition to resurrect my so called "father".~
@838   = ~Prophecy has no meaning to me, it defines a fate that manipulates others' lives.~
@839   = ~This is exactly what I think. If you are a believer, you might relate everything in your life to a scheme called fate.~
@840   = ~What do you think of my prophecy?~
@841   = ~Your so called father thought of his end and also a way of reviving himself. A pathetic way if you ask me. Some of your siblings may believe the prophecy and try to revive Bhaal. But still this does not make the prophecy a fact.~
@842   = ~It involves about my heritage, how I can use it and what it will provide to me.~
@843   = ~So you think you are the one described in the prophecy?~
@844   = ~Only getting rid of the recent troubles I am having, nothing else.~
@845   = ~These are some petty troubles you talk about. Soon you will get rid of them, saving your sister Imoen, confronting Irenicus. But what then?~
@846   = ~You are a bhaalspawn, <CHARNAME>, and you know the prophecy. I heard about it, prophecy of reviving Bhaal long ago from an old priest. You fit the conditions of the chosen one but still you have to take the course towards the end to fulfill the prophecy.~
@847   = ~Do you ever think that you are the one in the prophecy?~
@848   = ~I acquired you into my group because of your combat abilities, not to chat with you.~
@849   = ~My combat abilities are only under my control. You can only order me to "kill", not point the target.~
@850   = ~My target is only a doll, his/her name becomes what I speak. Don't test my patience, there is no reason doll's name can't be "<CHARNAME>".~

@902   = ~Considering your heritage, it is not a false statement to think your cogency and inducement are fueled by the fear of your bloodline.~
@903   = ~I don't make others follow my orders with fear. They understand the reason and perform their duties responsibly.~
@904   = ~If so once they realize why they perform for you, which the sole reason is you are their leader, they will turn on you. Reasoning and responsibility cloud your visions only, not theirs.~
@905   = ~Although fear is a better way to enforce others, power pose long term loyalty.~
@906   = ~What if you let someone more powerful than you to join your group? Will you state your loyalty to your own group's new leader?~
@907   = ~Enforce them with fear instead. Power can be lost or become unusable in rare conditions, but fear can be maintained without power. Be manipulative, even if it is not their idea, impose it into their will. ~
@908   = ~You know, Jaheira tried to force you many times on your decisions. In the first lack of authority, she will be your new leader.~
@909   = ~I have no reason to take over this party, Lena. I only follow <CHARNAME> because <PRO_HESHE> needs our help to protect what we have.~

@911   = ~Khalid is dead because a mad wizard tortured him with no reason. Imoen is taken because the same wizard caught us to make experiments and we escaped that fate. Not every party is like what you think, especially when it comes to reasons, Lena.~
@912   = ~Believe what you think. Without a proper party hierarchy, every party is doomed to perish.~
@913   = ~Is this your former party formation depending on?~
@914   = ~You cannot just behave everyone like nothing. You won't accept if I behave you like nothing.~
@915   = ~You should, you already do. Why do you order me around to kill someone, <CHARNAME>? Am I a guardian or assassin for you?~
@916   = ~Why do I attack an enemy even if it is not threatening my life? Why should I risk my own neck for you? After all these you can still say you respect others?~
@917   = ~I am not against those; I love slashing flesh with my blade and you order me to do so. A mutual agreement it is, nothing else.~
@918   = ~You would not let me use you until the very end as you speak. In my first attempt you will leave.~
@919   = ~Why do you really follow me, Lena? You have no obligation to stay with me except my rescue you from the infernal plane you were stuck.~
@920   = ~As we already acknowledged, I will follow you with your recent troubles and you will be a time killer for me as I have nothing to do.~
@921   = ~I once was similar to you, leader of a raider party in Blood War. If you are willing to listen, I can share my experience with you.~
@922   = ~I have not time for your past.~
@923   = ~Just make it quick.~
@924   = ~Alright, let me hear that story of you. ~
@925   = ~As I said, I was once in a raider party in Blood War. I did not gather the so called companions. We were selected and even I was at the lowest rank.~
@926   = ~We were just peons in the war. Some higher rank enforcer gives us orders, we follow. The orders were generally to kill someone from the other side.~
@927   = ~Our party had members with different ranks, a small troop divided into squads. My initial rank was the lowest in one of the squad of course.~
@928   = ~Our missions consists of 3 major parts; infiltrate, eradicate, vanish. Infiltrate is performed with stealth and secrecy. Eradication is performed in most brutal way; we were free how we kill others. Vanishing is our most difficult sub quest. During our escape many would perish with enemy bolts or blades.~
@929   = ~After many successful missions, promotion to a squad captain came as a reward with my combat talents. This is the part where my leadership starts. In my missions I volunteered to take the most offensive parts. Sometimes distraction, sometimes execution, sometimes falling behind to slow others down... I liked this way, to be at the edge of life and death.~
@930   = ~In our raider party there was no concepts like comrades. Everyone was in a hierarchy among others. I was a squad leader and all others were under my orders. Instead of this, I changed the squad structure to something like yours as soon as I became the captain. I asked others for advices, allowed them to perform in their own minds, not like the word "trust" you would use but trusted them, observing from distance.~
@931   = ~You explain your squad was similar to our party now. I still don't understand why you are against my attitude.~
@932   = ~With your patience <CHARNAME>, you will learn the end of the story. Allow me to finish.~

@934   = ~With your patience <CHARNAME>, you will learn the end of the story. Allow me to finish.~

@938   = ~Sometimes best survival method is to leave another back. In secrecy of course, I killed or wounded many of my squad members to slow down enemy. This both allowed me to promote faster, also increased my chance of survival even in the worst circumstances.~
@939   = ~My party members' advices were important to me for only one care. If I fall or slow down for some reason, they would finish me off with ways based on their advices.~

@978   = ~Let me answer it for you. You lie to your so called "companion". Something like "not worth it", "no gain in it", "have no time for this" will be the reason you speak. Your own will is the only reason.~

@1105  = ~And my determination of saving Imoen does confuse you.~
@1106  = ~You deal with powerful and very dangerous guilds, oppose a dominant wizard guild, slay powerful foes...just to save her. Word "sister" must have a special meaning for you.~
@1107  = ~I look back to see the path we walked together until now. There are many corpses behind and their reason of death is very simple: blocking you. That is something to be jealous of both of you and Imoen.~
@1108  = ~Jealousy does not fit you, Lena. ~
@1109  = ~To be honest a bit, both of Imoen and you. I was the single child of my parents, actually mother, and "sibling" have no meaning to me. My childhood was completely solitude, no play, no games, no fun. Only torture, survival and pain.~

@1115  = ~I will do but if you ask nicely.~

@1343  = ~Don't tell me you are afraid of unknown. Besides I did not ask a profession you can do or not. My dream profession is like something I have no idea.~
@1344  = ~Farmer, far away from so called civilization.~
@1345  = ~Ignorance is bliss. Just living your own life with whatever you cultivate. What a boring life!~
@1346  = ~Exactly, I would not be bothered by any kingdom living my own life, caring for nothing else than the crop's quality.~
@1347  = ~You really have weird ideas, <CHARNAME>. Why not steal from someone else? Why work that hard just to settle your hunger?~
@1348  = ~I want to work for my own life, I am not a thief.~
@1349  = ~You don't have to be a thief to settle your hunger. Besides if you want to be productive, produce something rare and valuable.~
@1350  = ~What would you do as a profession Lena?~
@1351  = ~What is wrong about working hard?~
@1352  = ~It is about the rarity of the crop you cultivate. What I mean is, if you are going to give so much effort, then produce something spectacular.~
@1353  = ~You are aware that the food we buy from inns or markets come from farmers, right? ~
@1354  = ~Someone has to do farming, I agree. What I mean is, it should not be us. We are both talented on many other things like spellcraft, combat tactics, stealth and others.~
@1355  = ~Why reduce your level to someone who cannot wield a sword to chase away the wild boars from his farm or cannot take a pot from a cupboard without waking whole neighborhood.~
@1356  = ~I won't comment about the ones who fear from magic because I value Valygar's opinions on this as a genuine source.~
@1357  = ~I would say if magic has corrupted your family, you would understand but you have no understanding of family, Lena. Don't busy <CHARNAME> with your defamatory and depreciatory ideas.~
@1358  = ~I have not insulted you, idiot. You are the perfect source for magic-cowards. That's why I mentioned your name here.~
@1359  = ~You should think of becoming something more important and spectacular instead of a low weakling.~
@1360  = ~What would you do as a profession, Lena?~
@1361  = ~So you want to be something big and important? A queen?~
@1362  = ~Please tell me, Lena, what kind of talent does your dream profession requires? ~
@1363  = ~I would like to be not bound to anyone. That is what I meant.~
@1364  = ~Do you think farmers are not bound? They are bound to nature and nature is chaotic, you can never be completely sure how the weather will be next day.~
@1365  = ~What would you do as a profession, Lena?~
@1366  = ~This is adversity of agriculture. At least nature is something acceptable to be bound.~
@1367  = ~Adversity? One year weather is good and your harvest is in good quality. Next year because of storms, blizzards and floods you starve. Is this your definition of adversity?~
@1368  = ~In a few years you will be guessing how weather will be with your experience. Besides you can always switch the crop you are growing.~
@1369  = ~(sigh) Alright <CHARNAME>, one year eat all the banana you grow, next year cucumber.~
@1370  = ~Soldier or guard perhaps, always dreamt of myself in shiny armor leading armies.~
@1371  = ~Considering you had same skills as now, you could promote to general if you live like a millennium.~
@1372  = ~If you had same skills as now, you would be the lowest rank soldier for your lifetime.~
@1373  = ~It is not about becoming a general or militia man. It is about protecting something you value.~
@1374  = ~You protect the kingdom or law or order, something that does not care about your existence.~
@1375  = ~Of course it does. You become a part of it.~
@1376  = ~You misunderstood. When you protect a kingdom or law, you are the enforcer. You carry out your kingdom's orders and laws. Assume, your kingdom starts a war with another kingdom. You have to join the army of course. Maybe as you say, you direct the army.~
@1377  = ~The kingdom will never ask your opinion to start the war or not. You join army because you have to. Even if you don't support the cause, you might die for it. I would never do such a "bound" profession.~
@1378  = ~I am sure your dream profession is not a "do whatever yourself want" one, Lena.~
@1379  = ~What would you do as a profession, Lena?~
@1380  = ~As long as the ideal is same, you would go until the end.~
@1381  = ~Laws can be changed, kingdoms can fall. At least protect something that is static and permanent.~
@1382  = ~What would you do as a profession, Lena?~
@1383  = ~With your skills you could promote in ranks quickly.~
@1384  = ~Maybe but I hate others ordering me around. Unless your fighting skills are legendary or you are a prince, you will become one of the lowest rank.~
@1385  = ~Tell me one profession that does not have ranks, Lena.~
@1386  = ~What would you do as a profession, Lena?~
@1387  = ~Don't tell me you want to be general without any effort?~
@1388  = ~I don't. You might work hard to get that promotion but some idiot landlord's son or daughter can get that promotion from the king itself. Where is the effort or right in this, <CHARNAME>?~
@1389  = ~I could not bear being a simple guard for a long time. I need to promote or I would quit.~
@1390  = ~You might work hard to get that promotion but some idiot lord's son or daughter can get that promotion from the king itself. Where is the effort or right in this, <CHARNAME>?~
@1391  = ~Believe me, such things always happens and everywhere. In Blood War such things are common. I saw many demons promoting in a very short time, because the general is fond of his sexual desires and some succubus wants to promote quickly. You guess what happens.~
@1392  = ~Did you ever do such a thing?~
@1393  = ~Never. I despised such bribes and promotions who has a backer behind. If I had the chance, I would have killed them and did as justice.~
@1394  = ~What would you do as a profession, Lena?~
@1395  = ~I could do such a thing, I am not against such. ~
@1396  = ~I am sure you know what people call such women. Do whatever unless that calling disturbs you.~
@1397  = ~I despised such bribes and promotions who has a backer behind. If I had the chance, I would have killed them and did as justice.~
@1398  = ~I could do such a thing if I was female, I am not against such. ~
@1399  = ~I despised such bribes and promotions who has a backer behind. If I had the chance, I would have killed them and did as justice.~
@1400  = ~Sailor, actually a pirate. Robbing ships and selling them on other ports.~
@1401  = ~This is same with adventuring, pirating is not a profession. Also I assume you meant fisher when you said sailor.~
@1402  = ~Pirating IS a profession. It is like trade; only difference is first owner is not willing to give their goods.~
@1403  = ~If someone is not willing to give his goods then it is thievery, nothing else. Thievery is not a profession, <CHARNAME>.~
@1404  = ~If you are putting your life into danger, then it is a profession, Lena.~
@1405  = ~Sure <CHARNAME>. But fishing is not a profession then. Also farming, even cooking.~
@1406  = ~Reversely, thievery is not a profession, protecting nature like druids is not a profession either. Protecting a town from orcs, how would you explain this as a profession, <CHARNAME>? Not every profession has something to do with risking your neck.~
@1407  = ~What would you do as a profession, Lena?~
@1408  = ~Instead of jumping to a sea full of sharks, selling goods for cheap seems like a good trade to me.~
@1409  = ~Perhaps. But when I say profession, it must be something more spectacular.~
@1410  = ~I wanted the freedom oceans and seas provide. Traveling around the world, jumping from joy when you see a silhouette at horizon, watching sunset everyday...~
@1411  = ~Hmm, it was tempting until you said sunset.~
@1412  = ~What about sunset?~
@1413  = ~I hate sun. Simple enough, my skin becomes itchy under sun. My profession should protect me from sun.~
@1414  = ~What would you do as a profession, Lena?~
@1415  = ~You won't find such freedom from any other profession; just ignore sunset if you wish.~
@1416  = ~I can't ignore sun when sailing on a boat. My skin becomes itchy under sun. My profession should protect me from sun.~
@1417  = ~You can be considered a pirate.~
@1418  = ~Me, a pirate? How?~
@1419  = ~You are a pirate Lena, you stole my heart.~
@1420  = ~(with a sarcastic voice) What a romantic sweetheart you are, <CHARNAME>! Save those words to city harlots or town flowers, I am not like other girls you encounter in a random town brothel.~
@1421  = ~No one can stop me flirting with the beautiful and smart tiefling in my group!~
@1422  = ~If someone talks to me like that, I ignore them, <CHARNAME>; you would waste your breath on that.~
@1423  = ~We were talking about professions and now you changed the topic to what a heart thief I am. You really are unbearable.~
@1424  = ~Sorry, I changed the topic, let me ask what is your dream profession then.~
@1425  = ~At least you know how to fix things, else you would be intolerable.~
@1426  = ~I can't let missing this chance to flirt a beautiful, smart woman like you, Lena.~
@1427  = ~Flirting with a beautiful, smart woman like me? So it is not something special for me? You tell those words to every girl you encounter on road, don't you?~
@1428  = ~We were talking about professions and now you changed the topic to what a beautiful and smart woman I am. You really are unbearable.~
@1429  = ~Pirates use hit and run tactics. Your combat style is exactly like that.~
@1430  = ~Now that you mention, yes I agree on that. ~
@1431  = ~You changed topic with this though. We were talking about professions and now you are comparing me with pirates.~
@1432  = ~They equip like you, not so heavy armor, light swords, no shield.~
@1433  = ~To jump from a moving ship to another while only holding a rope and jumping into a bunch of enemies, I need to be very dexterous like you.~
@1434  = ~Cook, I already love cooking but in this new life cooking for earning. Open an inn and be innkeeper maybe.~
@1435  = ~I have seen better cooks, <CHARNAME>. You might love it but you have no special talent on cooking.~
@1436  = ~Reversely I have never seen you cooking. At next camp you will do cooking.~
@1437  = ~I don't cook, because I don't know how to cook.~
@1438  = ~No, Lena, everyone in my group should do their chores.~
@1439  = ~I warned you, if I put poison instead of salt, don't blame me.~
@1440  = ~You are lying, Lena. You are an adventurer, it does not have to be best but you know cooking, admit it.~
@1441  = ~Alright, I will cook instead of you then.~
@1442  = ~Really? I have to stock my pack at the next marketplace we find.~
@1443  = ~I did not say I am talented at cooking. Did not you ask what I wanted to become? I want to become a cook!~
@1444  = ~I commented on your cooking only, no need for outburst.~
@1445  = ~What would you do as a profession, Lena?~
@1446  = ~Sorry for my outburst then. I just dreamt of making delicious meals even gods would want to taste.~
@1447  = ~Apology accepted. You really need to work hard to improve your cooking. I doubt a god will come and taste you delicious meal. I would not waste a second chance with such a profession.~
@1448  = ~I never wanted to be best cook around. Cooking is a soothing habit for me.~
@1449  = ~You have to be good at cooking or no one will recruit you as a cook. In this case you cannot consider cooking as a profession.~
@1450  = ~I never had the full cooking set from a castle's kitchen. I could improve myself if I had such a chance.~
@1451  = ~So true, also cooking requires continuous practice.~
@1452  = ~What would you do as a profession, Lena?~
@1453  = ~With practice comes the skill. It will be a matter of time to be a master cook.~
@1454  = ~Actually cooking is an art, without any talent I cannot be the cook I dreamt of.~
@1455  = ~Unfortunately you speak truth. It should be an art, not a profession. Not everyone should do cooking but you know, we call everyone cook who can prepare meals.~
@1456  = ~I am a bhaalspawn seeking to fulfill my destiny. I can't be bothered with mediocrity.~
@1457  = ~I know you cannot use your brain something other than food and murder but asking you nicely to at least force to use it for a different purpose. ~
@1458  = ~What would you LIKE doing if you were not the same <CHARNAME> as now?~
@1459  = ~I have no talent for anything else.~
@1460  = ~I did not ask you if you have any talent for things other than adventuring. What would you LIKE doing if you were not the same <CHARNAME> as now?~
@1461  = ~Why bring up such useless things? Next time think about something we all can use in battle.~
@1462  = ~Am I really a war golem for you? I can't believe you see me as a ware.~
@1463  = ~Correct, you need to work hard to master the skill but I am not sure if it is worth in the end. After all you need to work for weeks maybe years and in that time you could become something else.~

/////////////////////////////////////////

@1501  = ~Sun is up on sky torturing me with its rays all over on my skin. There is not a single cloud to block that damn thing.~
@1502  = ~It is not windy either, not even a soft breeze. I would give anything for a cold wind.~
@1503  = ~I know it is summer but is it always sunny here? ~
@1504  = ~It is summer, the weather is normal, maybe a bit hotter than average.~
@1505  = ~Is that too hot for you?~
@1506  = ~Heat is not the problem here, sun is. I can resist much colder or much hotter weather but your sun simply makes me suffer.~
@1507  = ~Sunlight makes me itchy for some reason and under yours, it becomes a torture. Within shadows or darkness I feel like relaxed but under sunlight a heavy weight pushes on my whole skin.~
@1508  = ~Also my vision is a bit dazzled under sunlight, I can't see the edges of obstacles from a long distance but have no issues on close things. In darkness or nights, I have superior vision unlike your blindness.~
@1509  = ~You have to resist until evening. Is there day-night cycle in your homeland?~
@1510  = ~Not likely. We have 2 suns, one is red and only visible in day, and other is dull white but always in sky. Our nights are nothing like yours also, it is same with your most cloudy and dark weather at day here. At day weather is reddish, at night it is dark gray.~
@1511  = ~The cycle is a bit longer than here, it is nearly double. It did not make a huge difference for me because I rest myself after like 20hours in my homeland and here it becomes night.~
@1512  = ~Even though it is never dark like your nights, still weaklings hide during our nights because not all can see in darkness. They become an easy prey for demons because some of them can cast spells that cause darkness. Many demons use darkness as a weapon, an obstacle or a trap. ~
@1513  = ~You prefer the nights then.~
@1514  = ~Yes, nights and darkness and shadows, anything blocking sunlight. I do prefer darkness and I loved your nights especially without moon ones. I have not seen such a vast darkness outside in my homeland.~
@1515  = ~Can everyone in your homeland see in darkness?~
@1516  = ~Mostly yes. Not being to see in darkness is a serious handicap even though our nights are like your cloudy days. Most of my kind use darkness on weaklings without darkvision. Also we like to play with our preys first.~
@1517  = ~You are like one of those weaklings without darkvision?~
@1518  = ~Unfortunately we need magic for full vision.~
@1519  = ~Very pathetic, so you are blind in pure darkness. That is one more reason for camp light besides heat source at nights for your kind. ~
@1520  = ~Enough chit chat. We have a long way to go and we are still under that damn sun. Let's find some shadow or dark building.~
@1521  = ~We need a light source and see outlines only.~
@1522  = ~Only outlines, not full vision like yours.~
@1523  = ~At least it is something different than blindness. That is one more reason for camp light besides heat source at nights for your kind, not that you will need to match colors. ~
@1524  = ~I see perfectly in darkness like you.~
@1525  = ~There is no need to lie for such a simple question; I saw how you walk at nights, stepping over everyone.~
@1526  = ~What was the weather like in your home land?~
@1527  = ~Cold, always cold. It rains a lot here but in my homeland it rains rarely. Snow only exists at a small section of my country and I have not seen snow until like maybe I am 20. ~
@1528  = ~You would be lucky to see our suns from the clouds even at summer. We have two sun, one red visible on day only, other is dull white but visible always. Our suns do not radiate heat like yours. ~
@1529  = ~With the temperature low, walking under the suns for hours will not tire in my homeland but for one hour here will make you die from thirst. I don't think it is a heat issue but humidity.~
@1530  = ~I have walked for days on some average temperature areas in my homeland where as a human would freeze in maybe 10 minutes even with heavy clothing.~
@1531  = ~Is this why you don't use heavy clothing, weather is hot here for you?~
@1532  = ~I prefer light clothes because of my combat abilities. I can't move freely with heavy clothing; I feel like shrinked.~
@1533  = ~If you were thinking something else before you got answer, no, I am not using less clothes to expose my body. It is all related about my mobility.~
@1534  = ~Move along <CHARNAME>, suddenly I feel like peeped at.~
@1535  = ~I prefer sun over everything else, I want to see some light.~
@1536  = ~Reversely I prefer darkness. I can see perfectly in darkness unless there is some magic involved. Darkness in your world is a very surprising obstacle but for your foes. I am getting used to it every day and in my battle tactics darkness becomes a solid distraction.~
@1537  = ~Snow is better than anything.~
@1538  = ~Here is something we share again. I love snow except its effect on my mobility. Although I have no problem walking over ice or slipper places, running is near impossible on snow.~
@1539  = ~The view of snow is absolutely beautiful even though it dazzles me sometimes. I could watch the others struggling on the snow for hours.~
@1540  = ~I can endure cold to very low degrees so snow is not an issue for me.~
@1541  = ~I would like to see your homeland, it seems like an interesting place.~
@1542  = ~You need magical protection for enduring the cold of it. You cannot live for an hour even at the hottest spot without heavy clothing considering your chores you do at nights.~
@1543  = ~Also you can have difficulty in breathing. There is something here that burned my nose first time I stepped into your world.~
@1544  = ~I think you mentioned snow as the first thing you liked.~
@1545  = ~I might be a cruel, dominant and arrogant tiefling but there are things I admire also; snow is one of them.~
@1546  = ~Enough talk, let's find some shadow or darkness to rest under. I feel like dying from itching under sunlight.~
@1547  = ~Don't tell me you like playing snowball also?~
@1548  = ~I did not see snow until I am an adult and I did not fancy playing snowball ever. Snow is one thing, snowball is another.~
@1549  = ~Walking under the rain could be so romantic.~
@1550  = ~Now you started talking about rubbish things again. Are you one of the obsessed with romance or all of your kind are like you?~
@1551  = ~How come a female hate walking under rain? Nearly all of the girls I met like that.~
@1552  = ~Don't make a mistake of comparing me to a lowly damsel who is obsessed with romance. Walking under rain will earn me wet clothes, traceable footprints and hampered vision. I don't see a reason to like it.~
@1553  = ~I refuse to continue because you will start rubbish ramblings again.~
@1554  = ~My kind is normal but you are different, Lena.~
@1555  = ~I try to think practical about all of the things I see or feel. Besides, I have no obligation to like something others love.~
@1556  = ~I am not a common wanderer you would meet along your road, <CHARNAME>. Stop comparing me with other vagabonds.~
@1557  = ~Do you hate romance completely? ~
@1558  = ~Yes, because it has no use to me... But to be honest I remember using it to seduce some lowly males before I slit their throats. I admit it has some uses to me, rarely though.~
@1559  = ~What is it now? Complaining about weather? Come on Lena, give me a break.~
@1560  = ~I was not complaining fool but every word that comes out of my mouth disturbs you it seems.~
@1561  = ~I hope you will burn under the everlasting rays of the sun and perish until you are all dust.~
@1571  = ~What was I talking about, hmm? Oh, yes, your world's weather and sun. Weather is not windy, not even a soft breeze. I would give anything for a cold wind.~

/////////////////////////////////

@1601  = ~There is a saying "What does not kill, makes you stronger", <CHARNAME>. It is mostly used for warriors to improve their skills. If the warrior forces himself to his limits, his body would get stronger.~
@1602  = ~Do you believe in that? I mean do you agree or disagree?~
@1603  = ~Not really, never understood the logic of it. The only thing I gained was blood on my clothes.~
@1604  = ~You can always clean your clothes and get rid of the stench if you detest that. I question the moral meaning of it. Let me tell you a short story.~
@1605  = ~In one of our missions we were supposed to distract a shadow dragon protecting an enemy castle. Castle was not well guarded but the mere existence of shadow dragon was enough for us to fall back. One of our squads had to do the distraction and we were ordered to do so. At that time I was a mere soldier in the squad, a peon if you call.~
@1606  = ~Although our mission was only to distract, the shadow dragon was too eager to kill us. Due to the landscape there was not much to hide. We had to fight for our lives or run away trying.~
@1607  = ~In a minute three members of our squad were dead. In five minutes only three remained from a twelve member squad. Some of our mages and a few of our warriors injured the dragon but not lethal.~
@1608  = ~I was injured too but unlike finding a way to survive, all the blood spilt made me bloodthirsty. I wanted to slay the dragon so much. ~
@1609  = ~When you see your comrades slain one by one, you slowly lose your faith in yourself. Don't get me wrong, I don't care about them but, you know, decoy count was lowered to two only.~
@1610  = ~I decided to use my other two members as decoys and climb on top of the dragon as he lands. Everything was success, I climbed over the dragon before it flied to sky again, rushed towards his head and stabbed my sword to his head.~
@1611  = ~He was flying while I did, soon he fell to ground of course. I was on his back so he absorbed the crash impact for me but still I was near death because of my wounds. ~
@1612  = ~Dragon did not die immediately but agonizing there. All I could think of was to wait for him to die, take my sword and leave.~
@1613  = ~After ten minutes, he was dead. I took my sword and a part of his scale as my reward. I returned to my home town alive, only I survived from that battle. I took the scale to an enchanter and commissioned an armor from the scales. As you know, skilled smiths can craft powerful armor from dragon skins.~
@1614  = ~The enchanter made this leather armor for me (points the leather she uses). Believe me it was pure black, sometime later it returned to red like this now. Here is the part where I seek the answer.~
@1615  = ~The enchanter did a mistake, he only made an armor from the scale but the armor was not meant to protect the equipped, instead feeding on her. The first owner was me of course. ~
@1616  = ~When I donned the armor first time, my life drained. The pain was unbearable. I tried to take the armor off but I already lost my strength to do so. Enchanter tried to take it off from me too. I fainted there.~
@1617  = ~I woke up and saw enchanter's arm completely drained with no blood on it. He was trying to cure his arm, I was lying on ground with a headache, starving and thirsty. My skin also turned pale after that event. I realized the armor turned to red, it drained all my blood. ~
@1618  = ~So the moral is, the armor made me weaker in terms of my health but killing the dragon and the protection of the armor made me stronger.~
@1619  = ~What is your opinion on that?~
@1620  = ~Why don't you take it away if you despise it that much?~
@1621  = ~I did not say I despise it. It took me so long to obtain it and I carry it like a trophy. Also its protection against vampires is priceless. ~
@1622  = ~It does not hamper my mobility, Its magical enhancement is incomparable with other magical junk. Besides a simple issue, it is very usable and protective.~
@1623  = ~You are now much more stronger besides the side effect of the armor.~
@1624  = ~Against a shadow dragon or vampires, correct. But against others I am too fragile now. ~
@1625  = ~I still question this to myself, is it really worth or not. Unfortunately there is no balance in that.~
@1626  = ~You are a warrior and your health should be your number one priority. I say you are weaker now.~
@1627  = ~Before I was trained as a tempest I thought like you but now I feel opposite. A warrior should avoid any direct hit from the enemy at all cost.~
@1628  = ~Archers are the best killers until close combat, they can kill maybe an hundred but still walk alone without a scratch. My style is similar to archery but in close combat. It is not easy to land a hit on me.~
@1629  = ~We can say the advantages and hindrances of your armor are balanced.~
@1630  = ~I have met very different warriors with interesting enchantments on their weapons, poisonous beasts or dangerous mages. There is no balance among those. ~
@1631  = ~You can knock the weapon from the warriors' hands, dodge the poisonous darts and kill the mage before spellcasting. The armor makes no difference here.~
@1632  = ~Did you try to cure yourself or armor about this?~
@1633  = ~I tried curing myself with many clerics but they all told me to throw away the armor. They could not do anything to the armor and I could not throw away. ~
@1634  = ~They say the dragon is alive within that armor. I say it is his final hit on his slayer, a curse.~
@1635  = ~Does it still drain your power?~
@1636  = ~Constantly. Never-ending draining. See? (tries to pull from her shoulder but it is like stitched to her body and it only stretches, does not leave her body. Within seconds the armor slowly releases Lena's skin but with too much blood.)~
@1637  = ~When I say constant draining, it is like my blood also runs through it also. It seems I feed that thing with my blood just like my heart feeds my innards.~
@1638  = ~Is this why your back is cowered in blood when you take off that armor?~
@1639  = ~The leather is too thin and I am comfortable with that. I even sleep with that armor on. When did you see my back?~
@1640  = ~When our cleric were tending your wounds of course.~
@1641  = ~You were watching me naked? You are a pervert, <CHARNAME>. Leave me alone before I stab something at your eyes.~
@1642  = ~I peeped to your body when you were bathing.~
@1643  = ~What? How dare you? You are a pervert, <CHARNAME>. Leave me alone before I stab something at your eyes.~
@1644  = ~You misunderstood, your armor's back is sometimes cowered with blood in days we have not even swung a sword.~
@1645  = ~I was suspicious of it but could not prove. It is true if you say so.~
@1646  = ~One more question, would you use an item like this? I mean "drain one of your power but increase another" item?~
@1647  = ~I would not, that armor seems an evil item. Throw it away.~
@1648  = ~I am evil too, do you want to throw me away also? Just consider this...~
@1649  = ~Probably I would do same like you, I would use it always.~

@2812  = ~You did throw that away, did you?~
@2813  = ~To your surprise, no. I still keep that gift of yours but not because I appreciate or think of using it but because you value it more than I do. It is not like I don't care about your feelings but more like I don't feel the same meaning you feel for it.~
@2814  = ~When I took it from you, you expected a different reaction but probably some appreciation also. What did I do? Threw it at your face. ~

@2818  = ~Let's move on, we talked enough. In the future don't get your hopes high about me.~

@2824  = ~I know what a gift is but I was shocked to be honest. No offense but it is just a small piece of clothing for me.

It is not like I don't care about your feelings but more like I don't feel the same meaning you feel for it.~
@2825  = ~I gave you at the best timing but still your reaction was negative. I knew you would not keep it though.~
@2826  = ~Yes, I remember. Quite horny, about to be undressed for night and other things. I say perfect timing but something was wrong on our side as you got it from my reactions.~
@2827  = ~Would things be different if I bought you a new better sword maybe?~
@2828  = ~Hmm, that is a very hard question. You cannot compare a useless piece of clothing with a piece of metal you use to kill others considering your job is killing others. Let's change it to some boots for example, same style, metal plates attached but new and in better condition.~
@2829  = ~My reaction would be something like I don't need it and show no appreciation but I would take and use it, why not.~
@2830  = ~If you are curious let me tell you, I still keep that gift of yours but not because I appreciate or think of using it but because you value it more than I do. It is not like I don't care about your feelings but more like I don't feel the same meaning you feel for it.~
@2831  = ~Do you feel remorse for your reaction?~
@2832  = ~Do I feel remorse because I put that underwear you bought to me on your head? No, I would still do the same. If you had bought me something different I could use much more common circumstances, my reaction could be similar but I can't comment on that now.~
@2833  = ~Because you would love to see my face like that.~
@2834  = ~Because you would never use it.~
@2835  = ~Because you never appreciate anything.~
@2836  = ~Exactly. You know I take pleasure when I reject your good intentions back. My reaction was just same, it was your fault expecting some other reaction from me to such a gift.~
@2837  = ~Are you jealous of them?~
@2838  = ~Jealousy is not the right word for describing my feelings but curiosity fits better for the situation. I don't understand the magical thing that gives different meanings and feelings. Attaching other meanings to things and reasons are just beyond my understanding.~

@3343  = ~Don't look sad, <CHARNAME>, better luck on next time. (whispers when close to you) You could not woo a woman? Disappointing...~

@3354  = ~She is not my type.~
@3355  = ~I returned to see Anomen's face.~

@3368  = ~(All Viconia did was to insult the elves loudly in general to provoke the table behind her. There was some sun elves enjoying their night until Viconia realized them. Soon they left the inn. Viconia, having no one else to annoy, went upstairs to her room early.)~

@3370  = ~(During the all dinner and chit-chat you noticed Lena has drank nearly a whole bottle of wine. When she realized the bottle was empty, she called the waitress for another. From her movements it was obvious she is getting drunk.)~

@3384  = ~(You both come to stage and synchronize your movements with the waltz. Unlike previous time with her cooking skills, there is some truth about her dancing. She can't dance that well.)~
@3385  = ~(You both try your average with no really competition, still you and Lena are better than many of the couples. Soon the waltz end, all inn guests applauds and greet all couples on the stage, including you and Lena.)~
@3386  = ~(whispers to you) Idiots, I danced miserably and still they applaud.~
@3387  = ~No need to be cruel to yourself. You were really good.~

@3407  = ~Maybe. But I would not applaud myself.~
@3408  = ~You need to improve your dancing if you want to deserve these Lena.~
@3409  = ~I would insult you for making such a statement but you are correct unfortunately.~

@3423  = ~(You carry out her request, link arms of her and move towards upstairs. She walks slowly and hardly can stand alone without balancing her with something else. Slowly going up the staircase she stumbled a few times due to her alcohol level.)~

@3431  = ~Leave me alone, <CHARNAME>.~
@3432  = ~(You put something over her and walk towards the door. You hear a heave voice from Lena, when you look back, you see her vomiting on her other side of bed to floor.)~
@3433  = ~(All of the meal she ate tonight is floating in her room's floor next to bed. After a few vomits, she stands up and face you with closed eyes.)~
@3434  = ~(respond her kiss)~
@3435  = ~(While kissing she slowly takes off her clothes. First her skirt and next her blouse, she is standing with her undergarments.)~
@3436  = ~Your turn (She takes your clothes off and pushes your hand while trying to help.)~
@3437  = ~(You both sit on the bed with your undergarments, she climbs on top of you to kiss you but breaks.)~
@3438  = ~Give me a moment...~
@3439  = ~(She gets off the bed and looks around when she is in the middle looking for something. With a sudden burst, she bends and vomits... All of the meal she ate tonight is floating in her room's floor. After a few vomits, she stands up and face you with closed eyes.)~
@3440  = ~You clean this mess, <CHARNAME>; I will sleep in your room. (She takes a cloak on her and leaves you alone in the room.)~

@3507  = ~Listen, you are very special, <CHARNAME>, more than any of this group. We are all expendable but you. When the time comes, don't hesitate to walk away leaving me behind, at least do this for me.~

@3520  = ~Because I love you so much idiot, more than myself. I hate to see you suffer because of me.~
@3521  = ~I won't hold a grudge to you if you choose a fate for me. A shorter or not, it won't matter. ~
@3522  = ~I will never become a treacherous bastard even you ask, no, even you order me so.~
@3523  = ~If I am willing it won't be treachery, only a combat tactic. Besides I can become a very beautiful decoy.~

@3601  = ~Why did you take magical training Nalia? Why did you not continue your old profession?~
@3602  = ~My father wanted me to become a mage instead so I took the training and became a mage. Not that I don't regret but still love the arcane arts more than my petty thievery.~
@3603  = ~You had to give up your profession because your father wanted to. I blame your father for this but accepting what he planned for you? This is your fault, your weak will's. You are living a life someone else planned for you, Nalia.~
@3604  = ~Things are not like what they seem. I come from a noble family and we own a keep and many farms surrounding it. For generations our family has been landlord for those farms and keep. Being such a noble brings some responsibilities especially about influence.~
@3605  = ~A rogue may not have the same influence compared to a mage. There are many other families who want to take place of our position and they try such things by weakening us. If we don't stay still, other vultures simply will take everything from my family with their ridiculous bureaucracy.~
@3606  = ~I am the only child of my parents so everything my family owns will be mine one day. I don't want to lose them to others so I need to be strong, both in power and influence.~
@3607  = ~That is why I hate property; it dictates what you have to do instead of what you want. Damn the nobility and live your own life, become a rogue you wanted always.~
@3608  = ~No, what my family owns will stay within my family until I breath.~
@3609  = ~Live your artificial life then.~
@3610  = ~You try to help others with your wealth, Nalia. I am curious, how do those people react to you? Do they see you as a hero?~
@3611  = ~To be honest it is not like what you think. Some people are too proud to accept help from others. These people will simply ignore and reject any offer you do. These are the ones I feel sorry about most.~
@3612  = ~Some people appreciate what you do but there are times they take your arm while you offer your hand only. Greed is within people's hearts and mind, even offering a help of few year's spending they will ask for more.~
@3613  = ~Very few people I have met are way richer than me but still trying to take whatever they can. I made mistake of confusing them with regular townsfolk and end up trying to save myself from their pleads.~
@3614  = ~Have you also observed what they do with your offer?~
@3615  = ~Generally I don't have time to check it. As you know, as a group we move continuously from town to town. I never see them again, to be honest I got no idea how my offers ended up.~
@3616  = ~You give gold to a some poor jobless, he goes and gambles all money for double and loses all. He is poor just as before you gave gold to him. You give gold to another and he spends a year's spending within a week. Another one thinks he is more powerful and bullies some bandits. He lies dead dumped to a river probably.~
@3617  = ~Stop helping others, leave them alone and use it for yourself only.~
@3618  = ~It is my wealth I am spending, why do you care?~
@3619  = ~People think of us as a group and some bravest of them come to me also. I send them to you with a kick or punch. I was curious how they react to you after my actions.~
@3620  = ~I require some wisdom from a woman like you, Nalia.~
@3621  = ~Why me? What do you need?~
@3622  = ~At our previous inn stop the wine I asked was terrible, bad smell and the sour taste of it was disgusting. The bartender told it was the best quality they had but if so their standards were very low. In your noble life you tried and know about many different wines I guess.~
@3623  = ~Hmm, a very hard question. In the previous inn stop I did not ask for wine so cannot compare unless you speak the name of it.~
@3624  = ~Ari.. Arab... Aral... something like that...~
@3625  = ~Arabellan Dry probably it is, not a high quality but still very good compared to others. Maybe that bottle has gone sour. Try Blood Wine or Alurlyath. ~
@3626  = ~Blood wine is a dark red color wine with a lush taste. The grapes used for this wine is told to be affected by the dead which makes up the taste of it. Alurlyath is a white wine with a sweet taste which is generally stored in very good conditions. ~
@3627  = ~You probably won't like what I say but ask <CHARNAME> to buy you Alurlyath. It will have a better meaning.~
@3628  = ~Let's see if we can find them. I doubt they are common among these lands if the quality is that good. I ignored the part you involved <CHARNAME> to our conversation.~

@3633  = ~If you can tell me which guild your were spying for, I can tell you our little meeting.~
@3634  = ~Guilds and spying have never been in this poor bard's life. Sometimes only playing a tune to the interested wayfarers, sometimes acting on a stage in front of a not always enthusiastic crowd...~
@3635  = ~Around ten years ago, near the river Vnygarkdnaoz, Frozenstream, a town I can't remember its name, perhaps you can remind me.~
@3636  = ~Yra Orrym, or in common language Cold Anvil, small town known for their blacksmithing, beautiful blades with sharp edges, many trinkets made with cold iron. Aye now I remember it, you did well to remind me such cold memories, dear snow leopard.~
@3637  = ~Knowing such details rise an insuppressible question in my mind, Lena. Were this snow leopard involved in the massacre happened around those years?~
@3638  = ~Maybe...I don't remember though.~
@3639  = ~Massacre of the Vnygar Nyka, the Frozen Rose guild happened during a cold winter night, townsfolk escaped but members could not. A group of demon and tiefling attackers disappeared quickly just as they appeared from nowhere shortly after bloody slaughter; all of these happened in an hour under the moonlight.~
@3640  = ~And you reported these happenings to?~
@3641  = ~An infamous baron. Why dwell on such cold memories, let's dig them into our thick book of memories and seek new tunes my mindful snow leopard.~
@3642  = ~Have you dabbled into alchemy or ,to be precise, poison crafting? Your abilities perfectly match an assassin striking poison silently into victim's heart.~
@3643  = ~I find it a troublesome and redundant effort as I can outmatch my opponents one-to-one. Playing with them before their final breath is something I love to watch while they are struggling to escape.~
@3644  = ~Why using violence and ignoring the option to take the lord's life with a glass of wine? A tragic tune playing on background, an audience to be terrified with the play, other actors watching events in awe...~
@3645  = ~That rat is supposed to die, Haer'Dalis, either with my blade or a poison but this won't be a tragedy like you describe. Audience will call it a murder and believe me, digging out innards and ripping the victim's limbs terrifies the audience much more.~
@3646  = ~A bloody violent but unexpected tragic ending for such an actor on the stage. Curtains are closed for this poor sparrow too soon yet new actors come into play sharing their experience and bringing new excitements, giving diversity to the play.~
@3647  = ~Not always but in general yes. We need such actors don't you think so, Haer'Dalis?~
@3648  = ~We always do my scarlet leopard, we always do.~
@3649  = ~You live your name, Haer'Dalis, a jack of all trades. A dangerous warrior with dual blades, a significant spellcaster of arcane arts and a bard of many tales.~
@3650  = ~That is a nice point of view but there are flaws in it. I might be all of what you described but can never exceed your combat abilities, never become a mage of known through planes but only a bard.~
@3651  = ~We all have limits, Haer'Dalis, even our body cannot resist and endure our life styles sometimes. We are all adventurers, the gamblers playing with their lives instead of dice. What is important is to have the spirits up for improvement.~
@3652  = ~Does this furious leopard think she has reached her limits?~
@3653  = ~Not likely but improvements take long and the hardships I endure only empower a single bit. From your way of talking it seems like you have given up improving, is this correct?~
@3654  = ~Nay, Lena, if it was like that there is a misunderstanding between us. I might never exceed your combat abilities, which we can also say I am close to my limit. There are much more powerful archmages than me traveling through worlds or living their own adventures, I can never have such arcane powers nor I am ambitious about it. ~
@3655  = ~The only thing what I have near to nothing is my tales. I never feel full of tales, tunes, poems... There is always another tale the next corner, a new tune residing in an inn we are about to enter, a new poem not written yet but ready to be spoken from a former adventurer.~
@3656  = ~In my case, my little leopard, there is no limits. Even we draw a line, a count as a limit, I don't think I can reach it in a few years. Give me a century, a millennium, still no, not enough...~
@3657  = ~You seek something you can always improve but it has no use in combat so which is kind of useless. I wish combat techniques were such easy to learn.~

@3660  = ~Me, why? Sorry for my bewilderment, I never thought someone would be jealous of me.~
@3661  = ~To be precisely not you, your now ripped but long ago flapping wings, the feeling of flying you once had. I would change my tail for wings without thinking a second.~

@3666  = ~Faith has nothing to do with race, power or any other physical properties of the believer. I admit it is an uncommon choice but I am more than content with my decision.~
@3667  = ~I will never understand you believers. Faith does not help you survive in sea while drowning, or grant you invincibility when surrounded by wild animals. I always thought faith and religion as a way to unite against common enemies but your faith does not match in my description as you have nothing common with gnomes.~
@3668  = ~True, faith does not grant what you need in dire times but believing gives you a stronger resolution. With faith you can swim more holding your breath, with faith your will is stronger and animals are going to be scared of your determination and survival ambition. ~
@3669  = ~Faith can unite others for a common goal but it is not the ultimate goal. It unites people with same beliefs and with minor differences same life style and point of view.~
@3670  = ~Considering how you survived from your capturers, it is puzzling me how you are not a believer. You don't have a faith directed to a deity but to your determination and perseverance in order to survive even at dire conditions.~
@3671  = ~You speak wisely Aerie but no, I am not a woman of faith and never will be. I survived from that tomb but it was because of the careless guards and my opportunism.~
@3672  = ~From my point of view it is your faith that granted you patience and smart thinking for planning your escape. As I said it is not directed to a deity...~
@3673  = ~Yea, yea... You started speaking like same religious fanatics I have slain before they started chanting. Just tell your ridiculous ideas to others.~
@3674  = ~How do you resist those blood and innards you pluck out from your opponents, Lena? Don't you feel any urge to vomit or disgust?~
@3675  = ~Why should I? I am a warrior, let me remind you that lest you have forgotten. Killing is my job and I can't kill others like you do with your magic, I need to cut them into pieces.~
@3676  = ~Sometimes after our battles I observe the dead bodies of our opponents. They have tried to kill us and failed and now lying dead. Some of them are just killed with one swing at a critical spot with a concealed wound, one would think that body is alive. But some of their bodies are crashed into pieces, even its mother cannot recognize.~
@3677  = ~They don't resemble a body anymore, not human, not elf, not dwarf but meat pieces. How can you resist that smell, that ...view? ~
@3678  = ~It is just like a smell of a flower you have smelled a thousand times and a view you would stare at sky perhaps. You are the one who disgust such things but call yourself an adventurer.~
@3679  = ~I am sure others are like me. They do what they have to and resisting such conditions are necessary but I simply can't stand it. ~
@3680  = ~Then either leave the party or learn to cope with it. I have an idea, Aerie, next time we engage to combat again, I will throw the limbs of our opponents at you so that you can get used to them faster.~
@3681  = ~Nooo...~
@3682  = ~You are always pushing forward in battles to engage my opponents, trying to get more of the share for yourself. Is there a special reason for such effort?~
@3683  = ~I am not used to fight with halfling allies, Mazzy. I have no quarrel with your skills but for obvious reasons I forget what you are. I respect skill but could not get used to your size.~
@3684  = ~Such prejudices have always been in my life, Lena. I thank you for your respect but observing your behaviors towards me and others may I suggest you to consider less violent solutions and attitudes to our complications?~
@3685  = ~I repeat I respect your combat skills, Mazzy, but besides that you are no different than a walking piece of rubbish ideas. Don't get involved into my matters unless you want to lose my respect.~
@3686  = ~If you are going to lose whatever respect you have for me so be it but I ask you to leave your bloodlust and sadistic ideas aside.~
@3687  = ~I hate to harm children but you give me no choice. Knowing you are an adult inside will make things easier anyway.~
@3688  = ~Have you ever stolen something, Mazzy? It does not have to be gold or valuable things but even a small tiny innocent bit?~
@3689  = ~I have not stolen anything in my entire life, Lena. Is that too hard to believe such halflings exists?~
@3690  = ~You got the agility and reflexes but lack the courage and skill perhaps. Come on, just admit you have no skill in stealing.~
@3691  = ~Unlike what you think, I have not even tried to steal anything. Not everyone is like others especially when it comes to racial prejudices.~
@3692  = ~Are you trying to tell me you lived as a warrior hermit of righteousness for your entire life?~
@3693  = ~No, I am not a goddess of pure righteousness, I don't claim such a thing as you say. Of course I made mistakes due to my insolence but tried to undo the consequences of my actions.~
@3694  = ~Hmm, worse deeds than stealing? That is better.~
@3695  = ~Don't tell me you are comparing me with a demon such as yourself.~
@3696  = ~Should I remind you the racial prejudices?~
@3697  = ~Some of your actions harm what I am trying to protect and some of your speech insult the virtues I believe. Yet I think you could be a very different being Lena if you were born in this world for example.~
@3698  = ~Do you really believe such a thing?~
@3699  = ~Why not? The characteristics of our personality and the aspect for our lives are molded by the society we born in and grow up. Even a demon such as yourself could find tranquility and follow the path of righteousness within such a society.~
@3701  = ~First, The demon you call is not a real demon, Mazzy, I am a tiefling. Second, I prefer my own society than yours, some things cannot be changed even by the society. Third, you are a living example of your idea's failure.~
@3702  = ~I apologize for calling you demon, I keep forgetting this every time, Lena. And can you explain why I am a failure of my idea?~
@3703  = ~A halfling born and grown in a society where every single halfling is framed for thievery and there is truth in that frame but that halfling has not even tried thievery, has not fallen from her path of ideals. You can forget what you told me about the society now.~
@3704  = ~You are determined to find the flaws in someone's speech and ideals every time you dislike, right Lena?~
@3705  = ~Exactly...~
@3706  = ~Jaheira, is there a rank order within Harpers? ~
@3707  = ~Harpers is an organization founded in a friendly fashion, not like an army of a kingdom with officers of different ranks. But of course some of the members are heeded more than others.~
@3708  = ~I thought there were some kind of ranking but you say no. Very interesting, I was curious of your rank actually within the organization. Are you an important member within the organization?~
@3709  = ~Why are you curious about this, Lena? Will this make a difference if I am the least important or president of it?~
@3710  = ~There is no need for such outburst, Jaheira. Your authority in the party is well known and I thought you were some important member that have habits of ordering others.~
@3711  = ~Harpers are a group of people trying to do what is right and uphold what is good in this world. As a member I try the same within this party, I try to show what is right to others. Don't confuse me with <CHARNAME>, <PRO_HESHE> is the one giving orders here.~
@3712  = ~Do what is right and uphold what is good, hmm? Just my type of organization, it is better when they are gathered in a small area, I would have to chase them otherwise.~
@3713  = ~Lena, are you alright? You look much paler than other days. Let me check your wounds again.~
@3714  = ~I don't need care, Jaheira, I can look after myself and no, I am not ill as you think. I need some more sleep, nothing else.~
@3715  = ~I disagree. Why do you still try to look strong when you are not? There is nothing wrong for accepting being ill or needing care.~
@3716  = ~Beware Jaheira, you are on the thin line. Pushing more will make your condition worse than mine.~
@3717  = ~Insolent demon. I am trying to improve your condition and...~
@3718  = ~I did not ask for it. Leave me alone.~
@3719  = ~Fine, have it your own way. Just die away from the group, you will infect others otherwise.~
@3720  = ~I have heard that Harpers are disliked, even hated and have a lot of enemies. Is that correct Jaheira?~
@3721  = ~True but those are the slavers, evil practitioners, necromancers and other evil intention based groups. I doubt if someone would blindly hate or dislike Harpers when they are striving to uphold the good for them.~
@3722  = ~Harpers do not escape from their enemies I suppose considering what I have seen from you. Do they also perform assassinations or assaults to people on some critical positions?~
@3723  = ~We are not assassins, we strive for peace and balance but fight back only when attacked. Why do you ask such things now?~
@3724  = ~Would not it be a wise and easy option to assassinate a cruel and merciless baron, who is victimizing his folk, instead of fighting with his probably mercenary army? His counselors might be affected from his evil intentions perhaps, so called innocent which makes only baron the guilty and corrupted.~
@3725  = ~Circumstances might be different but assassination is not and will never be a way of Harpers like you think, Lena. Sure we will fight but there is always another way to stop this baron in your example.~
@3726  = ~If you or Harpers ever start assassinations or single target assaults, just let me know. Your organization will need professional killers in this field and I can make a few disappearances for them. I promise all will be quick and in secrecy.~
@3727  = ~Do you think Harpers will work with such a sadist, bloodthirsty killer like you? Are you dreaming?~
@3728  = ~I am offering you to do your organization's dirty work and here your reaction is quite offensive and insulting. I did not expect such a response to be honest.~
@3729  = ~The Harpers is not what you think, Lena, and never will be. Do not ever come to me with such ideas.~
@3730  = ~I feel jealous of my little <PRO_BROTHERSISTER> that <PRO_HESHE> got a warrior like you in <PRO_HISHER> party, Lena. Your battle goals match mine also, battling fiercely, without mercy and never escaping a good blood bath. ~
@3731  = ~While my style relies on heavy armor and weapons, yours rely on light armor and agility. We make a perfect pair in party that no one can achieve. I regret not meeting you when I was alive, I could be in <CHARNAME>'s position now.~
@3732  = ~Although I agree our battle styles complete each other, I would not follow you like I do <CHARNAME> now. From the stories <CHARNAME> told me about you, I would have left long before <CHARNAME>'s final confrontation. Loyalty is not something I value that much.~
@3733  = ~Hah, you say loyalty is nothing to you yet you followed my little <PRO_BROTHERSISTER> to <PRO_HISHER> doom and even hell. Either there is something between you and <CHARNAME> or you are playing with us both.~
@3734  = ~I follow <CHARNAME> and there is no special reason other than letting me walking this world of yours in addition to some minor detail. ~
@3735  = ~Ha ha... yes, that minor detail...~
// Sarevok's obsolete banter
@3736  = ~There is something I wanted to ask you Sarevok, only you can answer this question due to the circumstances you lived. What was your death like?~
@3737  = ~Just like any other mortal, Lena. ~
@3738  = ~I doubt it due to your father's essence, Sarevok. When we kill others their bodies become corpse, same body with minor detail changes but bhaalspawns do not leave corpses behind. I think death for bhaalspawns are different unlike a mere mortal. Just tell me what you felt.~
@3739  = ~There is only void in your soul's reside place. There is nothing real, you only feel, see and hear fake illusions. The only real things are darkness and shadows flowing around you.~
@3740  = ~Bhaal's essence left my body and soul when I died. What remained is my own soul, identical to a mortal. I waited <CHARNAME> as a ghost like any other undead you would maybe slash through. ~
@3741  = ~You say there is no sight, feeling or sound but here you stand in front of us due to your timely meeting with <CHARNAME> in pocket plane.~
@3742  = ~Bhaalspawn or Bhaal's essence is what your soul seeks like a man crawling in a desert without water for days. Imagine how would that man feel when he obtains water in a bottle full in the middle of desert. ~
@3743  = ~Actually it is more than that, words are not enough to describe. Don't worry Lena, you will see it when you die. Ha ha...~
@3744  = ~Probably my own will be different as I am not a bhaalspawn. I don't fear death but still knowing afterlife would force someone to avoid the inevitable with more power and struggle. You know what death is like, that makes you much more fearless and unstoppable. ~
@3745  = ~Believe me Lena, it is not something to be jealous of. Better not knowing that feeling than living it.~
// --
@3746  = ~I grew an admire against all drow race including you, Viconia. ~
@3747  = ~Why would that be?~
@3748  = ~I don't know how but with all your useless and weak struggle, you strike fear into all world just with tales to scare children. I have not seen anything spectacular from you so all the fear is proven to be just talk.~
@3749  = ~Ignorant fools like you will not understand why drow are supreme when compared to other weaklings. I admit we drow are not that active on the surface but that does not mean we are not up for our names.~
@3750  = ~All you do is to insult and manipulate others with some divine magic you can cast by chance. What kind of activity can you ever do when you are in your homeland? Were you not an outcast?~
@3751  = ~You are still ignoring drow vengeance and torture but I don't blame you. You come from an another world knowing nothing of drow and talking like we are dark skinned elves only.~
@3752  = ~Also I am not the only outcast in this party. Sometimes you forget where you are I guess.~
@3753  = ~I am fully aware of where I am yet you forget what you are doing here in this party. Oh, I remembered now, you are using <CHARNAME>'s reputation as protection because you cannot protect yourself alone when there is no one to order around.~
@3754  = ~I will ask you to repeat these when you come to me begging for tending your wounds.~
@3755  = ~There is some truth about those tales I admit, Viconia. Some drow match the description of their so told beauty.~
@3756  = ~Of course but I doubt why you are telling me those now. What do you want Lena, did you wound up yourself again? If so don't come to me, I used all our bandages on you.~
@3757  = ~Yes, drow are really up for their names. Here I show some appreciation and admiration about one of their distinctive traits and you show me another trait that is told in the stories.~
@3758  = ~There is no need for such outburst and reaction. My intention was to express my honest jealousy about your beauty but nevermind if you cannot understand it.~
@3759  = ~Stop playing games with me, Lena. I don't need admiration about something that is superior against yours and considered so by all others. Besides still I question your motive about your surprising behavior.~
@3760  = ~Just wanted to test something and you really played your role well, Viconia. I now understand others much more. I never thought I would have a chance to meet someone like you.~
@3761  = ~Still in riddles? Stop bothering me, Lena.~
@3762  = ~Why still hiding under your hood, Viconia? Do you still fear the "fear" of weaklings toward your race?~
@3763  = ~It is not about that jaluk. There is not a single being I am afraid of. It is something you also feel and very interestingly can resist but I cannot.~
@3764  = ~Sunlight?~
@3765  = ~Yes, that sunlight. If I ever become powerful enough to destroy or prevent its light, it is the first thing I will do.~
@3766  = ~I am not sure if you can survive there but you would love my homeland then. Without any sun like here, it is like a heaven to both of us in terms of sunlight our skins get.~
@3767  = ~Perhaps it is a good idea but later. I want to get rid of <CHARNAME>'s troubles first though it started to bore me.~
@3768  = ~I cannot agree you more on this the sunlight scared dark skinned pleasure slave.~
@3769  = ~I would never think of agreeing you in any topic but unfortunately I do in this you butcher harlot monkey.~
@3770  = ~I am quite disappointed, Imoen, especially after considering what <CHARNAME> and all others suffered so much just for a trouble starter.~
@3771  = ~I don't understand what you mean.~
@3772  = ~Can you at least stay calm and out of trouble? You were abducted once and I believe you liked it a lot; you still behave like trying to get arrested or be taken away again. Leave the items in people's pockets instead of moving them.~
@3773  = ~If you are talking about my initial abduction, I was not aware of the Cowled Wizards and their ridiculous rules. Even if I explain it to you for hours, you simply will ignore it. You were not there and don't know what I suffered so shut up.~
@3774  = ~Also I think you are the actual troubled one in this party. My petty thefts are not the actual threat here but we all look after you to protect innocent people from your prematurely rage, so called your taint.~
@3775  = ~It is not my fault if people's actions and speech disturb me. You would do the same when you hear others talking about the "demon girl" if you were a tiefling.~
@3776  = ~Talking about the "demon girl" does not earn them a blade in their guts by a crazy war machine. ~
@3777  = ~Crazy war machine? Hmm, I will take this as a compliment. Thank you.~
@3778  = ~What? Nevermind... I have some other ideas (giggles).~
@3779  = ~If you are ever caught, Imoen from your thefts, please ask the executioner to bring me. I will gladly cut your head or hands off or any part of your body with pleasure.~
@3780  = ~What a lovely wish you thought, Lena. To give you the same, if you ever caught and they decide to cut your tail off Lena, please ask the executioner to bring you to me.~
@3781  = ~You want to cut it? I despise that thing, Imoen, I gladly would ask for you if ever such a thing happens.~
@3782  = ~No, I will not cut your tail, Lena. I will bring a monkey tail to attach it to you, it will suit you better with the "real" thing.~
@3783  = ~IMOEN!!!~
@3784  = ~Have you ever considered taking revenge for what they did to you, Imoen? From the Cowled Wizards I mean.~
@3785  = ~Me, taking revenge? Nah, revenge is not my type. Those times past long ago, why did you bring this now?~
@3786  = ~Just curious, your magical powers surpass many other mortals now, also those wizards that made you suffer so much. You can take your revenge easily, even more, you can control them as their leader.~
@3787  = ~You have a good point but these times are over. I have no ambition to take control of a mage guild, maybe later but not now.~
@3788  = ~No? Just think of a mage tower full of rooms for the residing wizards and sorcerers, studying for formidable magical secrets. Think of the magical power you can gain by their studies...~
@3789  = ~I said NO...~
@3790  = ~...and their belongings stashed away in hidden pouches, or chests concealed in the tower itself, magical trinkets, lovely shining jewelry ranging from beautiful, exotic rings to dazzling, brilliant necklaces...~
@3791  = ~Well, that may change things but... why do you want me to empty a mage tower so much?~
@3792  = ~Expectation of your head to be crushed by a golem while you are trying to steal some gold from a random magical chest of course.~
@3793  = ~Ha ha, so funny...~
@3794  = ~Minsc and Boo admit, Lena, we have not seen a warrior like you for some time, fearsome and deadly, quick and silent, white and red...~
@3795  = ~White and red? ~
@3796  = ~Your skin and hair of course. What.. ah yes, Boo... thanks. Boo also reminded me the yellow side of you.~
@3797  = ~Yellow? I don't have anything with yellow color on me. What is that relation?~
@3798  = ~You are forgetting your yellow tail Lena.~
@3799  = ~Ohh, thanks for reminding me that damned thing Minsc.~
@3800  = ~No, no, thank Boo, not me.~
@3801  = ~Yes, Boo... whatever...~
@3802  = ~Minsc and Boo is curious about something, Lena...~
@3803  = ~No, this time Lena is curious about Minsc and Boo. Actually the question is to you Minsc.~
@3804  = ~Only to Minsc? No, Minsc cannot be without Boo. We will both think and answer your question. Ask away.~
@3805  = ~Damn, ok, whatever. Do you realize Minsc that this thing is just a common hamster and nothing else?~
@3806  = ~How rude of you, Lena, talking about Boo as a "thing". You should be ashamed with your behaviors. I suggest you to apologize from Boo.~
@3807  = ~Me, apologize from a hamster? Meh...~
@3808  = ~Have you heard of the grave news Minsc? Excuse me, let me catch my breath for a second.~
@3809  = ~What grave news are you talking about, Lena? Why are so excited, what is wrong?~
@3810  = ~They are coming for you Minsc, actually they are coming for Boo.~
@3811  = ~Who is coming for Boo? Boo, did you do something awful while Minsc was sleeping?~
@3812  = ~(squek)~
@3813  = ~The imperial knights, the fearsome, heavy infantry halberdiers are looking for a space hamster, to take it away.~
@3814  = ~No one shall take away Boo while Minsc is alive...~
@3815  = ~But they have acquired a space nut to lure the hamster...I mean Boo to their trap. The space nut was too delicious that even I was under its control for a second.~
@3816  = ~A space nut even mighty Lena was out of control? Oh no Boo, we must hide Boo from the space nut.~
@3817  = ~Yes, take it away so that they won't find Boo.~
@3818  = ~Boo, this is urgent, go and hide in my armor and don't get out until Lena says so.~
@3819  = ~(squek)~
@3820  = ~Don't worry, I will check around for the imperial knights and whereabouts of the space nut.~
@3821  = ~You are a true hamster lover, Lena, don't you think Boo...er no Boo no, you have to hide now.~
@3822  = ~You are a true living example, Minsc. When others told me that, I would not believe but you standing in front of me alive? Unbelievable...~
@3823  = ~Minsc could not understand what Lena means, Boo. Did you understand what she meant? No?~
@3824  = ~They say the sane lives a day, insane an eternity. You are an example for this.~
@3825  = ~Who is this Sane and why is he leaving for an eternity? ~
@3826  = ~From the looks of Boo, I sense he got what I mean. Right Boo?~
@3827  = ~(squek)~
@3828  = ~Be a good boy and tell Minsc about the story.~
@3829  = ~Don't worry, although Minsc could not get the moral, Boo will explain to Minsc in detail later.~
@3830  = ~I am pretty sure you will misunderstand but in our next fight, Lena, I don't want you to stay behind me. Just be in the front for incoming attacks.~
@3831  = ~You are right, I misunderstand your motive unless you explain in detail why.~
@3832  = ~I prefer keeping sight with my enemies and also my allies. You move way too fast to form an attack formation. If you stand in front of me always staying in sight, I can try to keep up with your attack style.~
@3833  = ~I doubt if you can keep up with my pace but I will do so to test it out your suggestion anyway. ~
@3834  = ~This is the best formation we can perform against single but powerful targets. We have to move like a party after all.~
@3835  = ~Single but powerful targets, I got it, Valygar. Don't worry, I will slay those fearsome, horrid and filthy magic wielding enemies before they raise a hand to you.~
@3836  = ~As I stated before, you misunderstood me but in a different way. I thought you would think of me throwing you into enemy hands but instead you associated this to my dislike of magic.~
@3837  = ~We call it fear of magic, Valygar. Actually no, the thing in my mind was something else but not everyone is same I guess when it comes to things to look at.~
@3838  = ~I have to admit, I am jealous of your speed sometimes, Lena. How you can move so fast and attack more than a dual weapon wielder swordsman is plain impressive.~
@3839  = ~My speed and attack pace is something I earned with constant training and proper technique performing. You could have acquired it maybe unless you wandered aimlessly in woods but you were too busy there, I know.~
@3840  = ~Now I feel jealous of <CHARNAME>. ~
@3841  = ~Why sudden change?~
@3842  = ~The strong will and flexible patience of <CHARNAME> obviously.~
@3843  = ~Nice try wild nemesis of filthy magic wielders.~
@3844  = ~I am wondering one thing, Valygar, rangers generally wander around with animal cohorts. I heard of legends rangers riding dragons as their mount and cohort. Do you have an ambition to acquire such a cohort to yourself?~
@3845  = ~I admit there are legends about such heroes and villains riding powerful dragons as their mounts but I don't think they indicate truth. Dragons for instance are cunning creatures with their own minds and egos, they would not follow a mortal like me so easily.~
@3846  = ~So true but I think in past I met such rangers who had such potential.~
@3847  = ~Potential does not mean exactness but a possibility only, Lena. What cohort he or she acquired is a mystery unless you heard of that ranger recently.~
@3848  = ~To be honest joining a battle by riding an ancient dragon would be a spectacular sight which will be remembered for centuries.~
@3849  = ~Spectacular I agree but I might be wrong about the "potential". He was just too afraid I guess.~
@3850  = ~I think I got the message, Lena.~
@3851  = ~A box of surprise you are, Cernd, a tainted soul inside but a wise hermit outside. My nature resembles yours a lot actually except being wise.~
@3852  = ~I respect your argument but disagree it unfortunately. I try to control my unnatural instinct and use it when violence is the only option left. You on the other hand, embrace your corrupt taint and fuel it with your rage and bloodlust, strive for further grim violence.~
@3853  = ~Violence is not my first choice generally, Cernd, though I confess most enjoyable it is. My world was full of violence, flowing through the streets of my hometown as if the source was infinite. Anyone would be drowned in that river, or become a part of it.~
@3854  = ~I am the part of the violence you talk about and violence is a part of me. We cannot be separated. Unlike me, your unnatural instinct is considered a disease which needs to be cured even in my violence ridden hometown.~
@3855  = ~You are confusing violence with bloodlust. Even the pure corrupted and tainted soul owner could balance self and obtain tranquility to be the part of the peaceful society. Violence you perform is not part of you but your bloodlust performs violence and you show no sign of regret for this.~
@3856  = ~I never regret spilling blood of ignorant, disrespectful fools ordering or lecturing me around, especially the blood of the ones who talk about tranquility and deny their own nature in the first place.~
@3857  = ~Spilling my blood with your blade will earn you nothing, Lena, neither my words did it seems.~
@3858  = ~I am curious about one thing that was on my mind for a long time Lena, I always forgot it to ask or other events made me postpone it until today. ~
@3859  = ~Ask away now then.~
@3860  = ~Are there any balance protectors in your society, druids I mean or maybe with other names they are called?~
@3861  = ~You don't know about the druids in our society? Hmm, not that I blame you for not knowing such a thing but yes, some druids reside in a section of my home country. They are not so nested within our society.~
@3862  = ~Even within the violence and chaos reigning supreme hometown of yours, there are ones who strive for the greater balance and protect mother nature. It is really...~
@3863  = ~I did not say they strive for great balance.~
@3864  = ~What do you mean?~
@3865  = ~The druids I mentioned about, control nature for causing destruction and chaos over their enemies. Controlling weather to freeze or burn their enemies, dominating animals for their meat shield and using overgrown plants to cage and trap their prey are their ways of "using" nature, not protecting it.~
@3866  = ~I feel shame for them calling themselves druids. Please don't call them druids who insult our names.~
@3867  = ~As you wish. If it will relieve you, I have slain quite a number of them as they attack around like crazy.~
@3868  = ~How relieving...~
@3869  = ~Cernd, I am bored of your other form. Even <CHARNAME> can transform into a something that radiates destruction with its presence. Your transformations seems like a caterpillar turning into butterfly compared to it.~
@3870  = ~If you are asking why I cannot transform into such a minion of destruction, be prepared to be disappointed. I have always tried to be the part of the balance even with my transformation. I will never turn myself into chaos and destruction minion such as <CHARNAME>'s ability.~
@3871  = ~I am not asking about balance or other useless things, but I have seen some druids transforming them into formidable animals. Can't you transform yourself into a dragon perhaps?~
@3872  = ~That transformation you ask is not a simple thing to accomplish, Lena. Soul and body have to be equal in the scale of the presence, only changing your body will not succeed. You have to empower your soul to handle such a transformed body which is the major difficulty here.~
@3873  = ~So you tell me that when your body transform, your soul transforms into it too?~
@3874  = ~Both yes and no, my soul does not transform completely but I empower it to match my new body to fully control it.~
@3875  = ~Does this mean you cannot fly when you grow wings for example?~
@3876  = ~Not an exact example for this situation but partially correct, transforming wings may not allow you to fly like a bird.~
@3877  = ~I have seen pure demons with ridiculously weak and small wings flying freely, Cernd. Either my eyes were deceiving me or you are lying.~
@3878  = ~Cause is the third option you ignored, the nature itself.~
@3879  = ~Ahh, yes, the nature, how silly of me I could not think of it...~
@3880  = ~Meh, sure <CHARNAME> has a weird taste in dancers, recruiting savage ones. And almost forgetting, damned dancer came with a tail!~
@3881  = ~What dancer are you talking about, Korgan? Insulting my fighting style because you are in deep frenzy, unaware of your surroundings while I am fully controlling the battlefield?~
@3882  = ~Hah, you are not funny demon girl, we all know who is the sane gut opener here when the skull cracking starts. You will never see this dwarf dancing around our dummies.~
@3883  = ~My fighting style might look like dancing to you but obviously you have never met a fast warrior and fought against one. With this belly of yours, you would be her dummy instead.~
@3884  = ~My belly is the proof of my health unlike your starving, sick flesh, Lena. At least those flies would stuck their axes in my muscles while they would have to collect your bones from ground after the first swing.~
@3885  = ~Comparing an untouchably mobile warrior with a crawling armor rack?~
@3886  = ~Forgetting that crawling armor saved your arse many times while you collect your fluffy tail and escape behind <CHARNAME>?~
@3887  = ~A dwarf saved my life in battle? That is a serious insult to me, Korgan.~
@3888  = ~What are you gonna do demon girl? Tickle me with that fluffy tail? Har har...~
@3889  = ~We both look alike tail lasher, we have deep loyalty to our former company.~
@3890  = ~Although my team was nothing like yours and considering the situation, yes, I agree on the similarities of what we did in past.~
@3891  = ~At least yer pale skull is not completely full of useless junk, have some space for real stuff.~
@3892  = ~But one thing is sure, neither you nor me is suitable for this party's leadership.~
@3893  = ~Me take back what I said before, now your jaw started to move like a retarded one. Tell me fluffy tail, why would not me rock as the leader?~
@3894  = ~Fluffy tail? How...er, nevermind... We would not leave anyone alive after our first quest dimwit beard head, that is why neither me nor the moving grumpy keg of ale is not suitable for the job.~
@3895  = ~Heh, it is not my arse to blame if they can't protect their shiny skull by themselves. But your pale skull has some good thinking going on in it. I agree we would never show mercy like <CHARNAME>.~
@3896  = ~Also if your jaw insult me again, me will hand yer skull in two pieces to you.~
@3897  = ~I would love you to try that, Korgan, really excited to watch you trying.~
@3898  = ~You have not talked much about what you are going to do after <CHARNAME>'s troubles. Will you return to the stone you came?~
@3899  = ~It is time to grow little Korgans swinging battle axes around and reigning chaos to whole dwarf clans. Also me was just about to crack my clan leader's thick head but had to postpone till <CHARNAME> leaves my beard alone.~
@3900  = ~Damn, I wish you were sterile. I cannot think of little Korgans... I think of going back to my world to not to meet them.~
@3901  = ~Also I am curious who would want to be your little dwarves' mother. Have babies with a keg of ale? Beah...~
@3902  = ~Meh, me can find a woman anytime me wishes in mountains of dwarf clans, demon girl. And when me say about women, I talk about real women, not the skinny, sick and looking like some kind of animal one.~
@3903  = ~No no, I don't want to hear your dream woman fantasies, Korgan. I am enjoying my life so far and don't want to make my next few years disgusting with your fantasies. Oh, I will never be able to sleep again.~
@3904  = ~Feared by all, Yoshimo, explain me please, why should others fear you when Yoshimo only targets their pockets?~
@3905  = ~Their pockets and their lives, Lena, I am a bounty hunter, not a simple thief going after their probably stolen gold.~
@3906  = ~You don't look like a bloodthirsty butcher and neither have a stomach for blood when it comes to killing. Your methods are way too kind considering mine and others in the group.~
@3907  = ~It is not what it looks like actually, just an old habit from older times, nothing else. Giving in alive yields better rewards so I am trying to neutralize first and keep them alive. I sometimes forget I am in this group for a different reason.~
@3908  = ~Your formation in your group is to kill your enemies, not keeping them alive. Next time try to earn your title by spilling some real guts.~
@3909  = ~Old habits die hard yet you are right. Perhaps I should keep an eye on you to see how you solve our little alive problems.~
@3910  = ~You remind me someone from my past, Lena, your fighting style resembles to her a lot. Besides you are being a tiefling of course, you also have very sharp differences but still sometimes I am about to call you with her name.~
@3911  = ~Sharp differences?~
@3912  = ~Your butchery and short red hair are too distinctive to notice you are not her.~
@3913  = ~She was not into killing then. You were close I guess else you would not remember someone like her from your past.~
@3914  = ~It is not like what you think, I mean about relationship. We shared many things but not I would call that close. And her hair was long and black like many of my people.~
@3915  = ~Complicated relationships are not something I am experienced much in. What happened that make you leave your homeland and her then?~
@3916  = ~In my country many people do not like my profession; they find it unreliable. She did not like either, it ended when she learned what I do to survive. I simply left not to accept my fate there.~
@3917  = ~Your past started to bore me, I was expecting some sort of action actually, not a tragic love story. ~
@3918  = ~There were but let's save it for later.~
@3919  = ~I don't know what <CHARNAME> thought when <PRO_HESHE> recruited you but your actions put this party in danger, Lena. Collect yourself and struggle more for this party's gain instead of your bloodlust (what a surprise it would be if this expectation from such a furious monkey would ever become true).~
@3920  = ~Why my presence put this party in danger is a bit vague especially when you try to control everything without knowing anything in actual battle.~
@3921  = ~My presence keeps this party survive, not your untimely rage coming from your innerside, Lena. Even standing a few feet close to you is too dangerous in battle.~
@3922  = ~I am completely conscious and aware of my surroundings during our battles, Edwin, especially when you are casting spells in front of our enemies and I am forced to save you from harm by slaying them.~
@3923  = ~Nonsense. Every member should play their roles, your role is to protect the most important one in this party while I take out them (is she aware who she is opposing?).~
@3924  = ~Correct in a way but everyone should protect themselves, we are in a party but also each of us are individuals. No one will be responsible for your stupid actions and risk themselves for you, especially I.~
@3925  = ~Your skills are meant to take out the threats against me in the battle, not opposing the main tactician for your self-centered and reckless actions (Meh, although a reckless and dangerous simian still beautiful and attractive, just my type).~
@3926  = ~Look who is talking...~
@3927  = ~Lena, a question for your color choice. Is there a special meaning of red for you that we don't know other than fitting your hair and clothes?~
@3928  = ~No, there is not. My hair color is natural red, dyed by the taint inside probably. My armor has a complete different history but in short it is red by coincidence. There is no significant reason, just coincidence.~
@3929  = ~Your outlook resembles a model showing accessories in red except that blade of yours. Just the view is quite fitting (not being tiefling would help a lot about the rage but acceptable).~
@3930  = ~I am not a model to look at, Edwin, and I can dye my blade color with red by spilling some foolish red wizard's blood too. If you are that curious, let me show you.~
@3931  = ~We are in a conversation, Lena, no need to bring up a blade into friendly talk. My comments were same as someone looking from outside (only the view of course, luckily they have not seen the raging beast yet).~
@3932  = ~For obvious reasons I don't appreciate, actually hate, being watched for man's own pleasures, especially yours. Now leave me alone before I dye your body into completely red...with blood.~
@3933  = ~You have become quite an archmage, Edwin but still I have not seen you performing for party use. It has been weeks since we could upgrade our gear. Why don't you enchant some powerful gear for our use?~
@3934  = ~As your words spoke the truth, Lena, I am an archmage, not a simple enchanter for your petty trinkets. You can ask <CHARNAME>'s butler if you need such toys (Bah, this vulgar monkey started to bore me again).~
@3935  = ~Of course I can ask <PRO_HIMHER> for such things but as an archmage available in our party, the request becomes a stupid question if directed to a simple imp. ~
@3936  = ~Anyway, nothing is free and I was ready to pay the price but now I have to think of another way of paying as an imp would not be interested in what I was about to offer.~
@3937  = ~I doubt if that butterfly accepts gold for such services. And from what I have seen, you probably would torture that pure thing to death after you got your trinket and the gold payment (a savage monkey is always a savage monkey).~
@3938  = ~What gold are you talking about? I am not <CHARNAME>, I don't have a gold pool. Some ...service was in my mind but nevermind those, I have to think of something different now. ~
@3939  = ~I am sure that service of yours consists of blood and torture in vast amount but let me hear of that before making my mind (no harm in asking, heh).~
@3940  = ~Torture? Blood? No, no, many consider it a pleasant surprise but as I explained, it does not matter anymore. If you allow me now, I have to find that idiot imp.~
@3941  = ~Off you go then (did she really mean "that", nah, still playing... but what if...).~
@3942  = ~Does your tail also increase your combat abilities, Lena?~
@3943  = ~My tail? No, why do you ask?~
@3944  = ~My uncle Bernard also were a warrior farmer like you, slashing through all his enemy pumpkins with his peeler but you know, he did not have a tail. He was also the fastest pumpkin peeler in all Sword Coast but he had competition with Winny the Phugh, furious turnip chopper. She always won against my uncle Berny when raced against time.~
@3945  = ~One day during a race in front of all kingdom again, Winny dropped an attachable tail. Her pace slowed a lot after she dropped the fake thing so my uncle learned about her little cheat, he won easily. No one saw the Winny the Phugh from that day on. Uncle Berny also disliked turnip choppers, he might have done something to her but no one knows...~
@3946  = ~I assure you, Jan, if ever I get rid of that damned tail, I will use it to choke you first.~
@3947  = ~I know that you have a special liking to turnip but I am curious if it is only you or all gnomes are like that. ~
@3948  = ~Turnip? Aye, Jan loves every kind of turnip food. Turnip juice, turnip pie, turnip cookie, turnip jam, turnip...~
@3949  = ~Enough. I asked if other gnomes are like you turnip freak or not, Jan. A simple "yes" or "no" would suffice.~
@3950  = ~Yes, they are, actually Jansen family invented other kinds of turnip food. My great great great grandfather Edward "Orange Beard" Jansen was a farmer known beyond all planes. He cultivated a lot of turnip types to see if he can transform turnip into other vegetables. He was one of those mad alchemists, you know, trying to convert gold into turnip. ~
@3951  = ~It is said that he tried many many different turnip recipes and most popular and deliciously spine shivering ones came to nowadays. For example turnip marmalade is the most known turnip food in whole Faerun. Edward the Turnip Beard invented that when trying to transforming a balor head into turnip. The result was not that expected but the marmalade was delicious...~
@3952  = ~I got my lesson, Jan. Just find someone else to tell your freaking stories.~
@3953  = ~I have a suggestion to you, Jan.~
@3954  = ~What is it? Something consists of turnips maybe?~
@3955  = ~Yes, exactly. You are getting old, Jan, it would be a shame if you don't deliver your experience to other younger gnomes. You would not leave such promising younglings lacking your special turnip experience, would you?~
@3956  = ~Of course I would not. I will tell those stories to the young Jansens just like my great great aunt Emily did. She gathered...~
@3957  = ~Stop, Jan. Listen to my suggestion first.~
@3958  = ~Alright Lena, it gives me weird gladness seeing you that excited about turnips.~
@3959  = ~What I suggest you is writing a book. A series perhaps, the great life of Jan Jansen and his Turnip Adventures...~
@3960  = ~Hmm, sounds tempting. Just like my great...~
@3961  = ~But you interrupt me at every time, Jan. Listen the remaining part.~
@3962  = ~Ohh, sorry Lena, please continue.~
@3963  = ~Where was I? Yep that turnip. Write a big book about turnips and your adventures. The book got to be very big, five feet might be enough, maybe not.~
@3964  = ~Retire from your adventures, find some secluded place so that you won't be interrupted and start writing your freaking turnip stories.~
@3965  = ~Yes, yes a great idea. I will write some sketches of it on the road. You can be my proof reader, Lena but don't sell it out before it is finished.~
@3966  = ~Damn, you cannot write such a great book without retiring from adventures.~
@3967  = ~No, I can do just like my great great uncle...~
@3968  = ~I am done, this is the last day I make a conversation with a gnome. Next time there will be no talk, just blood, plain, hot, spilling from deep cut wound blood...~
@3969  = ~In the temple of Helm during our training, priests taught us about your kind in very detail, the purest evil creatures of other planes and hell itself. Some of their most noticeable trait is their beauty. I now see you really match the description they made.~
@3970  = ~I did not know that my beauty affected you that much. Alright Anomen, answer this for me. Have you ever seen a succubus?~
@3971  = ~Unfortunately I had to slay two of them during my quests, Lena, they tried to affect me under their spells but they were not even beautiful as you. ~
@3972  = ~Let me guess, you were blind while slaying those purest evil creatures from the deep hells.~
@3973  = ~Of course I was not, with Helm's protection their beauty could not affect me in the slightest.~
@3974  = ~I doubt if they were real succubus but nevermind, I know the truth anyway. There is only one thing I will tell you...~
@3975  = ~Don't call me beautiful if you think a succubus is not.~
@3976  = ~During each battle our eyes seek you, Anomen yet you cast spells on yourself for some unknown reason. I don't even mention the magical healing spells you don't have left to cast on us.~
@3977  = ~Do I need to get permission from you to cast spells on myself?~
@3978  = ~No, you would not obey it anyway. Instead of casting spells why don't you join our battle to hit some enemy before we kill them all?  ~
@3979  = ~You might be a reckless warrior but I am not. I need to activate my divine defenses before I rush into glory. If you try to hold them a bit longer, you would see the wait was not in vain.~
@3980  = ~Yes, yes, you rush into a pool of blood spilled by all dead enemies. Before you rush into them be careful not to be tripped by their corpses and fall into blood pool.~
@3981  = ~All of this madness soon will end and I will get rid of you forever, you demon.~
@3982  = ~Were these for me? Why, what did I do to earn your hatred?~
@3983  = ~Your evil days of slaying innocents of course. There will be no <CHARNAME> or others to hold me anymore and you shall return to the hell where you came from.~
@3984  = ~Have I ever attacked you, Anomen?~
@3985  = ~No but it is not important. No reason is needed to vanquish evil and uphold the order in this world. ~
@3986  = ~Then you would love to go to my hometown, Anomen, I can take you there if you keep me alive.~
@3987  = ~A chance to strike a great blow into evil's heart. Of course I would but after <CHARNAME>'s issues.~
@3988  = ~Great, now I got excited and my bored spirits are again high up thanks to you. By the way I did not tell it initially but let me speak it. In my hometown no reason is needed to torture good and reign chaos over them, especially the foolish ones. Don't worry, I will personally take care of you.~
@3989  = ~If I did not know you personally, Lena, I would confuse you a harlot with acrobatics only a circus performer can do. ~
@3990  = ~Same here actually, Sarevok, if <CHARNAME> did not know you, I would attack you as soon as I sense your presence. I am not fond of ghosts especially former arrogant and weak bhaalspawns.~
@3991  = ~Daring words coming from a former soldier who is left to the enemy because of her weakness. ~
@3992  = ~I was left behind because they feared me more than death. A comparison of a group consisting more than a dozen of highly skilled demons with a simple bhaalspawn who did not know <PRO_HISHER> heritage while <PRO_HESHE> was reading books, shows who is making the "daring" remarks here.~
@3993  = ~Ha-ha-ha. Tell me Lena, how much gold we need to pay to a priest to heal you up after you sneeze?~
@3994  = ~A walking golem who is just a naked sheep when out of armor competing my superior reflexes? I am not behind heavy and thick metal with a 5 feet long sword away from his target. Unlike "others" I prefer to be close to my victims to feel their fear and desperate struggle.~
@3995  = ~I admit, a golem I am but an unstoppable juggernaut, not a simple imp beaten after the first hit. I have walked over the battle grounds pulling one or two corpses somehow stick to my body and still able to run in that heavy armor with those drag force. Just accept it Lena, you don't have a chance against a real warrior when it comes to a long lasting serious combat.~
@3996  = ~I have never been into a long lasting combat, it always ends up too soon. You know, combat is over when the target is decapitated.~
@3997  = ~Ha-ha, persistence. Bah, I don't have time to continue this meaningless argument, Lena. One thing is sure though, you are the last one I would ever want to combat as a real enemy.~
@3998  = ~Hmm, it would be a hell of a war. I hope I won't need to fight such a long battle, especially against you Sarevok...especially you.~

@4000  = ~Larchen'goushael, shortly Larchen, was a Shadow Dragon protecting castle of Vyrlarn.  He was slain by Lena during one of her missions with her former cult.  This armor is a piece of his skin as a reward for her mission and a reminder of the difficult battle she had but within it Larchen is still alive.  

Armor provides magical protection for physical attacks and also protects from life drain attacks.  Besides the physical protections of this armor, it drains the life force of wearer continuously.

This red armor is too thin, it can be confused with a clothing.  You have not seen Lena removing this armor.

Cespenar upgraded this armor with the Skull of the Lich, actually armor upgraded itself. Cespenar claims the armor drained the power of the skull and all the remaining was sand.

@4002  = ~Ooo, another demon, beautiful...hmm but why pale skin? OUCH... skin burns.~
@4003  = ~Keep your imp away from me, <CHARNAME> or you won't have a butler anymore.~
@4004  = ~Me apology my demon lady, you seem sick, nasty armor you have. Eww, still finger pain. It is really eviiiiilll.~
@4005  = ~You has another eviiiiilll item? Let's me combine them. With 10.000 gold, that nasty armor and the horrifying Skull of the Lich, I can make the armor more eviiiiilll.~
@4006  = ~No, I need it for something else.~
@4007  = ~As expected, and they call me selfish.~
@4008  = ~Do you want Cespenar to upgrade that, Lena?~
@4009  = ~Fifth does not have any such ability, he cannot even tie two leather straps. Sure, let's see how evil you can create, Cespenar. If you destroy the armor during the process, be sure to fly away very very fast.~
@4010  = ~Y-yes, demon lady. Okay...stands back, then.  Never use this...no, no, I use this recipe always, Bhaal asks me this shiny every day, yes...~
@4011  = ~I don't have that much gold.~
@4012  = ~If you bring me another eviiiiilll item, let's say a Skull of the Lich maybe, me combine them and see how eviiiiilll the new item is. Oooo, shiny eviiiiilll recipes...~
@4013  = ~Ooo, sharp blade you has demon lady. Lemme check it with my shiny recipes.~
@4014  = ~Do you want me to show you how sharp it is, on you perhaps, Cespenar?~
@4015  = ~No, no, no. All I wish is to make shiny things for master <CHARNAME>...also to you if you wishes.~
@4016  = ~Eww, smelly, dried, demonic, smelly demon claw. If you wishes ...and demon lady of course, with 10.000 gold and the Baalor Claw, me can enchant it to rip heads like nothing else.~
@4017  = ~Fifth does not have any such ability, he cannot even tie two leather straps. Sure, let's see how sharper you can create, Cespenar. If you destroy the blade during the process, be sure to fly away very very fast.~
@4018  = ~If you bring me a limb of a demon ...not yours demon lady... me combine them and make your blade more sharper. More more more sharper than my ...finger nail.~
@4019  = ~Cespenar does not work for free, shiny ones need gold, a lot of gold. Back to cleaning and come back when you has so much gold.~
@4020  = ~Ooo, selfish master. Let demon lady has shiny recipe item. She looks angry, maybe no more close times.~

@4115  = ~And this disturbed you, Lena? You were expecting some kind of welcome reaction after you tried to kill <CHARNAME>?~
@4116  = ~It is none of your business, it was something between <CHARNAME> and me. We did the duel voluntarily unlike <CHARNAME> listening to your tragic life with no choice.~

@4120  = ~I can't believe, <CHARNAME>, you are interested in this demon murderer. I have nothing left to talk to you.~
@4121  = ~Seems like you got rid of this witch's pathetic life stories. Hey, can you cry somewhere else, Aerie, I can still hear your sobs. Now, where was I <CHARNAME>?~
@4122  = ~I knew you would see your wrongs before this murderer completely controlling your actions.~

@4138  = ~Your brother? I am not sure if you did anything for your brother and now telling <CHARNAME> his actions saved you. Why would a drow male save your life knowing he will be dead for sure if cannot escape after what he did for you?~

@4201  = ~You did not let such an opportunity get away, <CHARNAME>. I did not even think for a second you would reject her intention.~
@4202  = ~Not that I willingly accepted. She forced me.~
@4203  = ~Although she forced me to do, it was a nice surprise.~  
@4204  = ~Could you please keep your mouth shut about my affairs?~
@4205  = ~Sure she did. Why you were not willing to sleep with a beautiful drow priestess is a mystery to me.~
@4206  = ~From what I heard around, males have to please the females whenever they request and punished if males refuse. Maybe I need to find a handsome drow male to please me...~
@4207  = ~Sure she did. It was Phaere's order I guess or your horniness maybe.~
@4208  = ~Hey, is it me to be blamed if she did not like your performance? Spit your anger to someone else, <CHARNAME>!~
@4209  = ~From what I heard around, males have to please the females whenever they request and punished if males refuse. Maybe I need to find a handsome drow male to please me...~
@4210  = ~You did not let such an opportunity get away, <CHARNAME>. At least answer this honestly, did she seduce you that much until you lost control or did you do it willingly?~
@4211  = ~Believe or not, she forced me. If I had choice, I would not do it.~
@4212  = ~Well, a bit of this, a bit of that but main reason was she forced me to do.~
@4213  = ~She seduced me with stripping in front of me and I lost control of myself.~
@4214  = ~Will my answer change anything? What happened happened.~
@4215  = ~For some reason I believe you. Not the part she forced but you would not do it if you had another choice. I don't dwell on such things but let me tell you this once. If you are playing with me, you are in real trouble, <CHARNAME>.~
@4216  = ~(sigh) Now that my lover slept with another horny girl, I need to re-win him back before he falls in love with that girl. Don't worry <CHARNAME>, you are the one who will be getting most pleasure out of it.~
@4217  = ~At least an honest horny <PRO_RACE> you are, <CHARNAME>. I can understand forcing you but considering your slayer change and you can resist it but cannot resist a drow seducing you? Quite unbelievable...~
@4218  = ~At least an honest horny <PRO_RACE> you are, <CHARNAME>. I can understand forcing you but considering your slayer change and you can resist it but cannot resist a drow seducing you? Well, stripping might affect you, I know, but I did not expect a drow would seduce my horny lover like that.~
@4219  = ~You are telling me that a drow priestess stripped in front of you to seduce and throw you into her bed? Alright...~
@4220  = ~If you are asking this question, things changed a lot already. Nevermind, I got my answer.~
@4221  = ~Just stay away from me for some time, <CHARNAME> until I decide what to do with you.~
@4222  = ~What happened? I doubt if she changed her mind that easily.~
@4223  = ~I rejected what she asked, that's it.~ 
@4224  = ~She was not that beautiful, not worth it.~ 
@4225  = ~I have someone else in my mind.~ 
@4226  = ~So everything happened that simple and she accepted your refusal without any issue. I overestimated drow passion that is told in stories then.~
@4227  = ~She was like a goddess, <CHARNAME> but you rejected her? You really have some problems with your eyes or weird tastes.~
@4228  = ~Really? That is surprising, suddenly I got curious about this mysterious woman but no, it is none of my business. Quite lucky she is actually, having a platonic lover.~
@4229  = ~Still I thought you would not let such a chance away. You disappointed me but anyway let's continue on that drow's next quest.~
@4230  = ~You come out too quick? Does not beautiful drow priestess seem attractive to you even when they are forcing?~
@4231  = ~Please Lena, I can control myself and no one can force me to do something I don't want to.~ 
@4232  = ~How can I sleep with a mediocre drow while a beautiful demoness loves me?~ 
@4233  = ~What are you talking about? What was she supposed to ask?~ 
@4234  = ~Come on, don't look sad, I am still a drow priestess. You can ask me anytime to order you to please me.~
@4235  = ~Don't get me wrong, I trust you more than anyone else but still I thought you would not let such a chance away. I am content with your choice but cannot say if you will regret it later or not.~
@4236  = ~No, that is not what you feel, you are telling this to allure me but sorry, it is not working. I am content with your choice but cannot say if you will regret it later or not.~
@4237  = ~You mean, she did not...? Can you tell me why she did call you inside her chamber alone?~
@4238  = ~To give the details of my next mission.~
@4239  = ~Alright, I admit, she asked me for intimate purpose.~
@4240  = ~Sorry, a secret she told to me.~
@4241  = ~Only this? Hmm, drow are really weird. Nevermind, let's continue on that quest then.~
@4242  = ~Why deny it while she did ask for a reason like this. I suggest not to play with my trust here, this is not a topic to lie that simply which can cause other complications.~
@4243  = ~Now that we are over that "little" issue, let's continue on our quest.~
@4244  = ~Hmm, why only to you? Did she see through our illusion? No, I don't think so, else she would be dead now. Nevermind, let's continue on our quest then.~
@4245  = ~I would not give such valuable eggs to a demon, <CHARNAME>, I hope you ask for something really worth it.~

@4256  = ~This is what you get if you decide to play with me, <CHARNAME>. Don't look at me like that, you deserved it. Now all city is against us, we have to escape here and look for an exit of Underdark.~
@4257  = ~I can't believe you gave those eggs to the demon over such a thing.~
@4258  = ~GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE I KILL YOU!!~
@4259  = ~I admit my fault but is not this too extreme? I could die here.~
@4260  = ~If you insist that much...~
@4261  = ~In such contracts demons perform exactly what they are asked. This case was no exception, it did exactly what I asked with the precious eggs you had.~
@4262  = ~I warned you long ago about such a thing could happen. It is your fault for letting your desires disregard my love and loyalty. If you are too bothered about my behavior tell me what to do now. All city are after us, we have to get out of here.~

@4746  = ~Already ate, icy one. Cespenar genius...~
@4747  = ~You bastard flying dishwasher!~
@4748  = ~(Fifth flies next to you and speaking in a low voice) You <CHARNAME>, I have a word with you. I won't see you around Lena anymore, she is mine.~
@4749  = ~Really? Let's see what she thinks about this.~
@4750  = ~What? Hell no... (flies away)~
@4751  = ~Aha, here comes your cookie (slap him).~
@4752  = ~Cookie? Where?...(with the impact of your slap he falls to ground and flies up again after he collects himself) How dare you idiot, smelly, god of chickens!~
@4753  = ~Beat Cespenar if you really need to beat someone, <CHARNAME>.~
@4754  = ~He abuses your relationship with him, he deserved it.~
@4755  = ~(slaps Fifth) Then you deserved it you piece of trash...~
@4756  = ~No... (trying to escape but failing compared to Lena's agility.)~
@4757  = ~I gave him a cookie but he did throw it back, he deserved it.~
@4758  = ~He is not a simple animal, don't pet him like you do Cespenar.~
@4759  = ~(waits behind Lena and when she is done talking to you he flies next to you) This is not over <CHARNAME>, she will be mine in the end...~
@4760  = ~You can have her if you like, I am out.~
@4761  = ~Ohh, good...What? No, you treacherous bastard, how can you play with Lena's feelings? I will show you what you deserve!~
@4762  = ~(Lena was standing behind Fifth and overheard all conversation. As soon as Fifth dives to attack your face, Lena catches his tail and pulls toward her) Idiot, he is playing with you. (and slaps...)~
@4763  = ~But master ...ouch... <PRO_HESHE> said ...ew... no, no, no not there...AAAA!!!!~

@5000  = ~Here is a beautiful but furious demoness to corrupt my pure nature with her dangerous tainted allure. A demon to flint my calm passion, a fire to burn my skin, a tail...~
@5001  = ~A tail?~
@5002  = ~Yes a tail to embrace and envelop my entire presence with her taint and enticing perfume, a gaze to paralyze my body with joy...~
@5003  = ~Brave words from a man about to collect his limbs from floor. Please, go on...~
@5004  = ~Why showing me your cruel and coy nature instead of passionate and fiery one, my scarlet demoness?~
@5005  = ~Actually you seem like a helpful man and can help a lady like me to take a bath. Am I correct?~
@5006  = ~A bath? Of course I can help, let me ask Bernard if the bath tub...~
@5007  = ~Bath tub? No need for it, I was talking about a blood bath with the blood of a man speaking bravely but foolishly to seduce a half succubus...~
@5008  = ~B-blood bath, a s-succubus? Oh, I see now, my w-wife yes my wife is calling me, yes honey, coming honey, of course honey...~
@5009  = ~A lost warrior you are, seeking a new life. You met your doom, actually <PRO_HESHE> met <PRO_HISHER> doom, you.~
@5010  = ~Dangerous you are and jealous. With a mistake you will ruin everything, what <PRO_HESHE> is struggling for. ~
@5011  = ~What can I say, thanks for the meaningless and fanciful ramblings. I am not trying to ruin <CHARNAME>'s efforts in the least.~
@5012  = ~So this is your world, a civilization made by humans. I think there is not much difference but we will see. Let's move on.~
@5013  = ~Hmm, seems like I will enjoy your world more than I imagined, weaklings walk towards me to be slain.~
@5014  = ~I say move on and ignore these fanatics, I prefer my head on my body. The moment they realize I don't believe what they do, pikes and pitchforks will be pointed towards us.~
@5015  = ~Don't we have more important issues than doing errands for foolish temples? Bah, I can't believe you are convinced with their lies.~
@5016  = ~Now that I started to like this Mae'Var fellow. Too bad he is involved into some kind of treachery and his days are numbered.~
@5017  = ~I can't believe you just let this thief slip away from our hands. You are going to cause us trouble with your untimely mercy.~
@5018  = ~Finally, all talk is done. Now is the time for drawing our blades and swing until he is dead.~ 
@5019  = ~It will be a dangerous quest to kill Mae'Var in his guild, but also a bloody funny one.~
@5020  = ~Can you not stand for blood? Agree to Renal and let's rip Mae'Var's head off from his body. I promise, I shall be the one doing dirty bloodshed work.~
@5021  = ~A man asking death of another one. I would jump on that quest unless they were wizards but something smells here. Be cautious!~
@5022  = ~There is nothing smelly here except you, demon. I was talking to <CHARNAME>, not to you. Don't address me directly if I did not call your name.~
@5023  = ~Let's go and meet that mage first, <CHARNAME>, maybe he will make a better offer than this clown.~
@5024  = ~Getting rid of druids once for all? I like this idea more. Tell us the details my friend.~
@5025  = ~I thought we were in wine cellar, now the sight of a dwarf who won't be recognized by his own mother because of dirt on his face explains the disgusting smell and filth in this room.~
@5026  = ~Har, har! The demon has a sharp tongue, it will look good around my belly once me finish butchering with ye!~
@5027  = ~We are sent to kill you svirfneblin and we mean to do it as bloody as hell. Entertain me with your screams whelp!~
@5028  = ~It would be better if you end up dead but it is ...Veldrin's choice that keeps you alive. I was eager to test your highly spoken combat skills for real. Let's see if Veldrin changes <PRO_HISHER> mind.~
@5029  = ~What! Are we going to rest in a stable? Are you out of your mind, <CHARNAME>? Resting outside will be more healthier and safe than this filth.~
@5030  = ~There is no need to burst out such words, demon. No one forces you to stay but let me tell you, my prices are way lower than other...~
@5031  = ~I said no and it is final answer! <CHARNAME> might fancy resting in a stable as a horse but I don't!~
@5032  = ~You can't be serious after all we have done to reach her. Reconsider your decision, <CHARNAME>, we can't leave her here!~
@5033  = ~A demon walking in the halls of Order of Radiant Heart! State your intentions before we are forced to throw you out seed of evil!~
@5034  = ~My intentions? Well, it is fortunate you asked a seed of evil for this. With this sword of mine slashing through...~
@5035  = ~(silence her by gagging) Nothing actually. We are just passing through.~
@5036  = ~(whisper to Lena) This is not a good time, Lena. Save this for later, after we used these silly knights.~
@5037  = ~(cough) Sorry, my good knight, there were a few ideas in my mind to try on dummies for combat and was loud thinking which you misunderstood. To be honest your hostility and racist speech is quite disturbing, a bad surprise heard from someone in the holy halls.~
@5038  = ~Oh...I ...Forgive my initial outburst ...m'lady... but as you would agree your kind is not always peaceful as you speak. If there is nothing else, I have a word with <CHARNAME>.~
@5039  = ~I would like to test his skills of swordsmanship but before spilling his blood, we might ask his help for fighting the vampires and Bodhi perhaps. We can go after him anytime later I guess.~
@5040  = ~Is this the Drizzt from the bard tales that tell epic stories of deeds, swinging dual blades, fighting fiercely with all kind of enemies without fear?~
@5041  = ~I would not call them epic as you say tiefling but aye, probably the actor in those tales is me, standing in front of you.~
@5042  = ~(whisper to Lena) I know what you are trying but we can use them so stop.~
@5043  = ~(let her continue)~
@5044  = ~(sighs) Good, good. I heard of a few things about you from unlikely true sources and seems like they are too off from fact. A drow of 9 feet tall and yellow bright hair, quite an imagination. (whispers to you) Must you stop me every time?~
@5045  = ~Ha-ha. No my friend, as you see with your own eyes I am far from the description you are told. You have not answered my question yet travelers. You are not a foe, I presume?~
@5046  = ~Good, good. I am tired of listening to your overly exaggerated tales of unlikely real deeds. It is time to show your skills to a real warrior than posing and telling false events to bards for fame.~
@5047  = ~An expected behavior you show for a pure evil fiend. You will find no easy target here, fool tiefling!~
@5048  = ~For some weird reason I fancy this woman and her offer more than the other one. At least she is honest in the deal and cheaper.~
@5049  = ~Best thief is the dead thief but if it is the only way to continue, so be it. I think dealing with some cutthroats or cutpurses won't cramp my style.~
@5050  = ~No, it is already sharp but if you like I can show you how easy it can cut limbs, you will get an idea of its sharpness.~
@5051  = ~Aaa, no-ope, there is no need. I think someone called my name. A good day to you miss tiefling.~ 
@5052  = ~Someone started the killings before me? No way! We have to find the killer and end its miserable life as a punishment for getting my probable reputation.~
@5053  = ~In my world pirates were never trustworthy, I doubt if yours' are so.~
@5054  = ~Some adventurers will come... Waiting for someone else to solve their problems, pathetic! Wait, don't tell me...(sigh) Nevermind.~
@5055  = ~Oh, look at this sight. My far far long cousin lies dead and became a piece of armor for a tiefling in the end. Ha-ha, how pitiful.~
@5056  = ~(whispers to self) Damn, it is all this armor's fault. (shouts at dragon) Too bad you will end up some boots for us but be happy, you will meet your cousin!~
@5057  = ~Oh, really? Good, good, I like the way when they are cocky and not running with fear. Come closer tiefling and show me if you can live more than a few seconds!~
@5058  = ~Is this art, a play? Your society has really weird taste, <CHARNAME>. I demand refund for this nonsense!~
@5059  = ~Harpers, they used us until the very end. What an organization, sucking others' efforts for their own pleasure, no different than a vampire!~
@5060  = ~Watch your words, Lena! They asked us to perform for them and we agreed from the very beginning. They might have misinformed us on some topics but still a bargain is a bargain.~
@5061  = ~What a noble death! Hah, fool!~
@5062  = ~Many others call me cruel but you are more. Others will never understand how harmful they are actually to her by helping on every request and need. You did what you had to.~
@5063  = ~That gold piece probably will poof until evening. You should have left her alone to her miserable life. It is better to survive by herself, learning how to live day by day.~
@5064  = /*#22.1*/ ~Look a demon, run away!~
@5065  = /*#22.2*/ ~No way! Me will hunt her!~
@5066  = /*#22.3*/ ~Ouch! What the ...Here take your pebble back child!~
@5067  = /*#22.4*/ ~(Lena takes a bigger pebble from ground and throw it at child. With her skill, she hits the child in the forehead quite hard. You can see there is some blood spilling down on his face.)~
@5068  = /*#22.5*/ ~Aaaawwaaaa, my head....AAAAA....~
@5068  = /*#22.6 Jaheira*/ ~What are you doing, Lena! He was just a child playing with you, he did not mean any harm!~
@5069  = /*#22.7 Mazzy*/ ~This is outrageous! I won't allow someone from the party harm a helpless child! <CHARNAME>, before we become a child murderer stop this madness!~
@5070  = /*#22.8 Minsc*/ ~A boy is harmed? Don't tell me Lena, you did throw that stone! Boo says you should go and apologize from the child after treat his wound! Ah yes, Immediately!~
@5071  = /*#22.9 Valygar*/ ~I joined your group for keeping harm away from innocents but seems like the actual source of violence reside in your party. <CHARNAME>, you should take precautions before we become child killers!~
@5072  = /*#22.10*/ ~Oh, look here! An angry mob with pitchforks ready to stab me because I defended myself from a racist? How amusing! I doubt what you would do if he had thrown that pebble to your face!~
@5073  = /*#22.11*/ ~What happened happened. There is no need to walk over Lena for a simple issue. Child ran away already and we can't do anything for him now. Let's move on!~
@5074  = /*#22.12*/ ~I agree on most of you, what Lena did was harsh but Lena's behavior is not completely unjust. Unfortunately you will never understand this.~ 
@5075  = /*#22.13*/ ~I can't believe what you did, Lena! He was a small child with no harm to you. You could have killed him or hit his eye, making him blind!~
@5076  = /*#22.14*/ ~To be honest I did not think of you siding with me for this and I don't need your protection or approval. Still this does not mean I owe you nothing.~
@5077  = /*#22.15*/ ~Sorry but in your world I have grown a hatred against unfair racism especially if it is completely blind and ignorant. Next time prevent others' behaviors, not mine!~
@5078  = ~We all knew this would end up a bloody showdown. Why did you even bother compromising this animal in the first place?~
@5079  = ~Found someone to play with tiefling? Good, good. You felt so lonely there ignoring our friendship requests.~
@5080  = ~Hah, you offer slavery, not friendship, there is a difference, Lea'liyl. Now that I am not alone, we will check how your innards located in your body.~
@5081  = ~You break my heart m'dear. Your beauty will go wasted unfortunately.~
@5082  = ~Look here, I sense a tiefling among your ranks, Bhaalspawn. Before we start the bloody show, why don't you join my side dear, the winning side instead of this whelp?~
@5083  = ~Hmm, no thanks. I am content with my position here than in your cage.~
@5084  = ~Fool, you will end up dead like all others!~
@5085  = ~Wait, this is not a demon, this is something else...We don't need to fight it.~
@5086  = ~Very interesting. Let me take this.~
@5087  = ~Did I misunderstood the concept or just saw you paying money to a mage to legalize your spellcasting which comes with your own talent and expertise? Very funny...~
//: NEW STUFF
@5088  = ~Is this how you respond to pigs, <CHARNAME>? Watch whom your snorting is pointed towards pig! Taking back what you barked may extend your life or it ends right here right now.~
@5089  = ~You should never walked this earth demon girl and stayed under your mamma's skirt. Or should I say, climb trees and looking for banana!~
@5090  = ~Haha, good one Amalas!~
@5091  = ~Aha, monkey business!~
@5092  = ~Too sad, your life ends here. Let's see if you have balls to back up your words!~
@5093  = ~A fight against beasts! Can't wait to see the blood spill of the poor fellow.~
@5094  = ~Pathetic!!~
@5095  = ~I am shocked to see your enthusiasm not to let a man, who has no relation or you have no responsibility against, die at streets, <CHARNAME>. Carry him by yourself and do not lay that corpse on me.~
@5096  = ~Hmm, think about this, you capture one of your opponents and want to play a bit. Put him underground like buried and wait until hearing his screams and yells for help... Sounds like music to the ears, right? ... No?... Nevermind, I keep forgetting you are a member of the rescue team.~
@5097  = ~This smell, rotten flesh and limbs, not that disturbs me in the slightest, it reminds me the filthy dungeon I used to torture our captives in. Damn, I missed torturing...~
@5098  = ~Although I vote for the kill and save the headache solution, my situation was quite similar to them before you recruited me into your group, <CHARNAME>. Not that I feel mercy for them, what disturbs me is their current situation which fits exactly mine not long before. Do what you wish including anything bloody or not, I respect your decision.~
@5099  = ~Let's see, we are in a keep full of trolls and other abominations, none could sneak into the keep yet to see what is going on, none of the servants are alive. I am sure there will always be another explanation for this wench's corpse to Nalia, if you got what I mean, <CHARNAME>.~
@5100  = ~What? Why are you looking at me? Don't ever think of ...(sigh) I know what you think. But be honest, I am not behaving to you like this wench, not every time...~
@5101  = ~Oops! My bad...~
@5102  = ~Hello friend, I... oh, your dickey is slipped, let me fix it for you...~
@5103  = ~What is the real meaning of this question, <CHARNAME>, especially when one of their kind is traveling in your party? What do you expect her to say while I am standing next to you?~
@5104  = ~It is completely fine my furious fellow. Although we are generally subjected to such responses from local folk, occasionally we experience surprising behaviors coming from people with familiarity to our kind. Anyway, as our dear friend pointed out, we are people from distant lands and all of us are of mixed heritage. Please, my good <MANWOMAN>... will you aid us?~
@5105  = ~If you consider these men a threat, then do what you think is...~
@5106  = ~Of course my fellow knight, we will deal with these fallen paladins but due to current circumstances and nature of the quest, some heavy brawl and casualties are inevitable. My leader is also eager to hear about the reward, if you can name it, we will start the quest immediately.~
@5107  = ~Indeed.  Gloves of Healing would be a suitable reward for the task, I think.  Do you accept?~
@5108  = ~I can't believe some foolish knight asked us to slay some other knights. Don't disturb me now, I need to decide how to end their miserable lives while we are walking.~
@5109  = ~You are, <CHARNAME>, a big disappointment, also a wet blanket.~
@5110  = ~Racist bastards! You shall all beg for death when I am done with you!~
@5111  = ~Hmm, dead knights instead of beasts? This turned out better...much better...~
@5112  = ~There is a part of me saying this will be fun, other part suggests to enjoy our last moments... Let's see which side speaks the truth.~
@5113  = ~A wise but cowardly choice. Don't get offended, I would do the same probably.~
@5114  = ~Lena escaping a good brawl with a dragon? What happened to your bloodthirst?~
@5115  = ~Some choices extend your life even though they are cowardly decided.~
@5116  = ~Did the reptile just scare you or do I misremember someone provoking the shadow dragon?~
@5117  = ~Nothing. I trust you but not others, they look like searching for a solid opportunity to escape. Let's come back later with trustworthy dummies to finish the oversized reptile.~
@5118  = ~Nothing. I trust you but not myself yet. Let's come back later when I am in the mood to butcher this oversized reptile.~
@5119  = ~Indeed. Still we owe him a pinch of pain. Let's come back later to finish the oversized reptile.~
@5120  = ~I did not provoke the shadow dragon, that wrym was already eager to meet the inevitable so soon.~
@5121  = ~I am a new employee of the Lady's, I brought some new exotic faces to her fest hall.~
@5122  = ~Why are you...oh, I see...~
@5123  = ~Don't ever make such a gesture again, <CHARNAME>. Next time consequences will be very bloody for you.~
@5124  = ~No need for such outburst, Lena. It was a simple con to gain entrance.~
@5125  = ~Sorry, I had to do it to see Lady Galvena, it would look more convincing. Don't behave like you don't know the actual reason.~
@5126  = ~Meh, admit it, you would do the same.~
@5127  = ~So, how do you feel now? Mad? This is how we feel when you use us in combat as decoys.~
@5128  = ~I know but still I don't approve this. Next time use others, not me.~
@5129  = ~I would not, it would be an utter failure to present you as new courtesan. Also my taste in beauty is not that low.~
@5130  = ~Up to a point, I can accept it. But presenting me as a new courtesan? Unacceptable...~
@5131  = ~Up to a point, I can accept it. But presenting me as a new courtesan? Unacceptable... Put forward Viconia next time, she fits here better.~
@5132  = ~Very funny half fiend monkey, just keep on.~
@5133  = ~I try my best overcooked chicken.~
@5134  = ~If we can release and control the mages, we should try it for sure. We are talking about facing a wizard who stole your soul; any arcane power we can control will be useful.~
@5135  = ~Wow, a statue of Demogorgon!...~
@5136  = ~Are you blind? Text states animal sacrifice... Are you trying to call me monkey again?~
@5137  = ~Slaying some kind, working for other kind... Let's finish her little quest and return to our own body, I feel like an old woman with this white hair.~
@5138  = ~Boosting yourself after slaying weaklings who cannot event stand still? Is this how you pamper yourself in Ust Nasha?~
@5139  = ~Who dares to insult me, Lasaonar, the sword master of Ust Nasha?~
@5140  = ~Do anyone able to hold a sword claim to be a sword master here?~
@5141  = ~Enough!! Step into the pit and prove yourself, female!~
@5142  = ~Let's see how much you can last against a real warrior.~
@5143  = ~Attention! We are to have another challenge immediately! Lena will now enter the arena and face Lasaonar.~

@5502  = ~No...I mean of course, I met other tieflings before. But ignore my bewilderment, a tiefling is not a common thing you see in our world.~
@5503  = ~Thing?~
@5504  = ~I meant ...please, ignore my unfortunate words, I did not mean to disturb you in the slightest, forgive me ...m'lady. I wish you good luck.~
@5505  = ~Sister Garlena, please... Forgive our excitement, <CHARNAME> and also you m'lady. We are ashamed to confess this but events showed us we are close to useless, you cannot understand what your helps means to us.~
@5506  = ~Can you feel it, <CHARNAME>? There is something mystic in the air, something old and powerful ...something familiar...~
@5507  = ~Yes, I can feel it also. Don't worry, we will find it eventually.~
@5508  = ~Nasty smell... creepy walls... moving shadows... did you see that thing moving? It was just over there?~
@5509  = ~Familiar? It is just another dungeon we search for its treasure.~
@5510  = ~There is no doubt of it, we will eventually reach and see that Imprisoned One. I am sure it is some mad wizard Helm is afraid to release, what else could it be?~
@5511  = ~It was just a simple rat, calm yourself before... No, you are doing this on purpose to keep me close to you. Just walk ahead, fearless leader, I will follow you as a loyal companion.~
@5512  = ~While walking ahead also think about what the Imprisoned One actually is. I am sure it is some mad wizard Helm is afraid to release, what else could it be?~
@5513  = ~By familiar I did not mean that. It is like ...I have been here before, some part of me ...was here... but I never came to your world before.~
@5514  = ~With all things aside, think about what the Imprisoned One actually is. I am sure it is some mad wizard Helm is afraid to release, what else could it be?~
@5515  = ~A fallen and long forgotten god of course. What else a god is scared to imprison something here?~
@5516  = ~As you say someone powerful as Irenicus, maybe more.~
@5517  = ~A powerful demon maybe, a lord of terror and destruction. What was the name of the ruler demon in your lands?~

@5519  = ~I am the powerful demon here, don't compare me with some little imp hidden behind a corner. Also you can call me the lady of terror and destruction anytime you wish...~
@5520  = ~I suggest looking around before we release the demon. I doubt if he is lying but I feel like he is not telling us everything.~
@5521  = ~Let's think about the situation, we can see the portal and the caged demon in the same room. Demon says he can activate the portal if he is released. The demon is caged by fanatic priests. Do you think there is another way to proceed down? No, I don't think so.~
@5522  = ~I will unless you stop this madness at once. Now tell us why you are escaping from us and explain more about the demons you say.~
@5523  = ~Blood War... Most demons do not require a reason to fight each other, it is like their, also mine, basic instinct, to overpower the opponent in every case.~
@5524  = ~Yes, yes. It is bad idea to interrupt demons, let them fight. Yakman sneaks away until they give up chasing Yakman. They cast illusions to trick Yakman. Yakman does not fall into trap.~
@5525  = ~Let me guess, all you want is a special kiss which actually consists of a piece life force, right. And also you think I will let such a thing happen while I am around?~
@5526  = ~Oh, I did not notice your presence sister (giggle!). We have not seen a wanderer traveling with one of our kind for a very long time, well except the poor elf sneaking around. Poor elf. (giggle!)~

@5538  = ~To be honest, I did not mind working with devils at first but now I feel ashamed, making deal with devils to slay demons. Hmm, nevermind me, the feeling faded away already.~

@5540  = ~Ahh, I was sure this was the Prime Material Plane, until your beautiful face stroke my attention darling. Not only I lost all my focus due to your pretty face, some Primes also walk besides you my fair lady. Would you be kind to explain if we stand over Prime Material or still in Curst?~
@5541  = ~(whispers) A civilized cambion is never trustworthy. Cambion! I can tell you, we are on Prime Material Plane to respond your flattery.

@5543  = ~It was just a saying, I did not mean you, Lena. No need to be resentful.~
@5544  = ~I hate all demons, especially you. That is why I travel with a demon within my party, to hate more to be honest.~
@5545  = ~I hate all demons, especially you. That is why I travel with a demon within my party and also share my bed, to hate more to be honest.~
@5546  = ~Stop this nonsense, he is dying and does not have much time. Listen to what he says carefully.~
@5547  = ~I see. I hope you are not sharing this same hateful manner with other demons, right? Now let's stop here, he is dying and does not have much time. Listen to what he says carefully.~
@5548  = ~Something very familiar ...but powerful and ancient is here. Do not get surprised if those helmites imprisoned one of my kind here.~
@5549  = ~Was that the prince my kind feared all time, the tales of his power, his dreadness? Bah, he is banished by a simple tiefling ...with the help from a bhaalspawn of course.~
@5550  = ~Hmm, that explains why he was weak, which also shows I am still not that strong to overpower him yet (sigh). Well, that is my prince, go and fly to your freedom instead of these idiot helmites' cage... Er, ignore my last sentence please.~
@5551  = ~Tell me about Lena.~
@5552  = ~A demoness spreading terror and destruction wherever she walks. A warrior who cannot be even matched of swordplay and beauty by the most powerful and exotic species. A name shakes denizens with fear and cause them to pray their god not to meet her.~ 
@5553  = ~I doubt these words rings true, you only tell us what we want to hear.~
@5554  = ~I ...am trying to think about where I did made the wrong turn but still I cannot understand how things turned out like this. I expected ...a different choice from you but choice is yours. There will be a lot of free time to think about these events later, on my side.~
@5555  = ~I knew you would not miss such a chance, to become a god is no simple thing to reject. Still I think you should have chosen a path instead of balance of all things.~
@5556  = ~I knew you would not miss such a chance, to become a god is no simple thing to reject. I am not a faithful one but let me be your first worshipper, new god of the Faerun.~
@5557  = ~I knew you would not miss such a chance, to become a god is no simple thing to reject. I hope you have a few things on your mind about me too, new god of the Faerun.~
@5558  = ~All the essence of Bhaal and Melissan's bloody guts made me deaf, I could not hear you well.(sigh) You did reject the essence? Gave up godhood? How stupid ...of me, I should have seen through this.~
@5559  = ~So finally all of this madness is over. We are here waiting for your final decision to end this crisis once and for all. Besides all the troubles, a new god might be announced here, <CHARNAME>, I trust you will make the right decision considering what others standing next to you suffered because of your siblings. ~
@5560  = ~Here is the part where you start to impose your ideas into my mind.~
@5561  = ~Nonsense, you are the one giving final answer, not me. I stand next to you, <CHARNAME>, I am not blocking your path. Do not start flaming on me just because you are afraid of making the wrong decision.~
@5562  = ~What do you think, Lena? Any final words on this?~
@5563  = ~I told you what I had in my mind. The answer is ultimately yours, I am sure you will make the worst decision and I can start scorning you again. Still I will respect your decision, I promise.~
@5564  = ~Would you take the essence by yourself Lena if you were the Bhaalspawn here? What would you do?~
@5565  = ~Definitely I would not make others wait for such a frank question, just tell the Solar your answer and let's finish this all.~
@5566  = ~Not trying to rush your decision but if you don't give your answer to the Solar, they might be no Solar around anymore. Melissan just proved to be a warm up, nothing more for me.~

@6000  = ~Lena stays with you for some more time but soon cannot find the special reason to attach for long. You ascend with your final choice but Lena feels like left behind. She leaves your group and travels your world alone and with other groups. Later you hear of some disturbance at east, a group of warriors terrorizing local law enforcers. Their leader is an infamous barbarian human but many say that the red haired female tiefling behind him is the real head of them.~
@6001  = ~Lena stays with you for some more time but soon cannot find the special reason to attach for long. You happily live your new life in a small town near Candlekeep away from all troubles in the continent. Soon Lena starts complaining about your life and leaves you. Later you hear of some disturbance at east, a group of warriors terrorizing local law enforcers. Their leader is an infamous barbarian human but many say that the red haired female tiefling behind him is the real head of them.~
@6002  = ~Lena stays with you for some more time, looking for a mage that can cast a special protective magic from cold. Upon finding such a mage, you both walk into her world with your body protected from cold with wizard's magic. At first everything was again adventurous but your idea of settling down tires Lena in the end. Not long after, you return to your own world but she is still terrorizing local folk and threatening other demons' sovereignty.~
@6003  = ~Lena stays with you running from trouble to another. Your whole life becomes a game of terrorizing local law enforcers and humiliating them, soon all Faerun speaks your and her name with fear and hatred. Every town you walk into becomes a ghost town as you walk away from it. Countless priests and paladins are slain by you to stop your destruction. She never opposes you during the time but in the end because of a your blood thirst and jealousy, you kill her by turning into Slayer.~
@6004  = ~Lena stays with you running from trouble to another. Your whole life becomes a game of protecting her from local law enforcers and saving others from her destruction. Continuous movement becomes a part of your life, always on the road, traveling throughout all kingdoms. While Lena terrorizing those lands, you try to repel the law enforcers. Eventually tired of her reckless actions, you leave her to own way and move on. She does not let you go away so easily but in the end gives up. While you are busying yourself looking for adventures and treasure, you hear bards telling tales of Lena terrorizing far away cities.~
@6005  = ~Lena stays with you for some more time, looking for a mage that can cast a special protective magic from cold. Upon finding such a mage, you both walk into her world with your body protected from cold with wizard's magic. At first things are just like what you have being doing before, opposing other demons, killing others for petty reasons. Soon you meet her former guild and feel the destruction and terror they are able to cause. Eventually you become their target as an influential baron but luckily Lena saves your life many times with her smart thinking and former experience. In the end you both slay all of them one-by-one or in small groups and raze their hide out.~
@6006  = ~What of the inevitable pain you must give to the one you love? The female tiefling you name 'Lena'~
@6007  = ~Instead of pain you say, Gorion, he became the joy and reason of my life.~
@6008  = ~Va-len?~
@6009  = ~Valen, yes, you still remember my name after all.~
@6010  = ~What are you...No, you are not him, just an illusion that mage cast upon me.~
@6011  = ~I am not an illusion, Lena, but not alive anymore indeed. After all I have done for you, you are among the living and I, among the unrest spirits. All because of you.~
@6012  = ~You ...are dead? Don't tell me you...~
@6013  = ~Failed? Yes, because of your magnificent idea, do you still remember it Lena? I was the bait to the guards, was not I? I taught you how to wield that sword of yours, how to fight fiercely and you left me there after all of these.~
@6014  = ~No, I ...never meant that...You, chose to separate... No, you are not Valen, Valen I know would be standing brave with his choices, not blame others.~
@6015  = ~You gave me no other choice. We could survive both but you chose to leave me behind to guarantee your escape.~
@6016  = ~I did not leave you behind, you already know this...No, you are not Valen!~
@6017  = ~What now? Raising your sword to me? To the tiefling who taught you how to swing it in the first place?~
@6018  = ~Stop it Valen! Stop!... Please stop!...~
@6019  = ~Stop this Valen! This was never Lena's fault!~
@6020  = ~Stop, Gorion! She doesn't deserve this!~
@6021  = ~Enough! I won't allow this to continue!~
@6022  = ~It is all a lie, Lena! Don't believe it!~
@6023  = ~It has been a while since we separated, isn't it Lena?~

@7000  = ~Things started to get confusing, <CHARNAME>. One sibling you rescue, other you slay. One sibling you raise from death, other you pursue to kill.~
@7001  = ~Seems like your family issues will be your whole life problem until you are the last breathing.~
@7002  = ~They are not family, the ones I have slain.~
@7003  = ~What about Imoen and Sarevok? You took final breath of many foes for your sister and gave your life essence to your long dead brother. I remember you saying Sarevok tried to kill you and also killed your foster father.~
@7004  = ~You keep your sister close to protect her which is understandable up to a point even though she is a trouble starter. But why keeping your murderous brother around? Why don't you simply slay and move on like you do to others?~
@7005  = ~Why keeping your murderous brother around? Why don't you simply slay and move on like you do to others?~
@7006  = ~Why did you raise your brother and even the consequences of your action could be disastrous?~
@7007  = ~I did not raise Sarevok because of my love towards him.~
@7008  = ~You still did not answer my question but I think you don't want to answer it. So be it.~
@7009  = ~Anyway, let's leave the ones you keep close but there are some other siblings you recently learned of. Especially the Five we learned will cause a lot of problems it seems.~
@7010  = ~Have you noticed each time you slay one of them your taint gets stronger? Your aura becomes much more overwhelming and distractive. Do you feel pleasure when you kill another bhaalspawn?~
@7011  = ~Just the same pleasure I feel when killing any of my foes, no difference~
@7012  = ~Strange, I thought you would feel something different because of the taint inside you. I feel you get stronger each day or maybe I am not enough to keep up your power. ~
@7013  = ~When we met your recent siblings first time, I thought you would make agreements with them or reunion like a long separated friends. I am content though how they ended up, their blood spilling to ground from my blade.~
@7014  = ~For some reason I feel like I am slaying gods. You know, your kind is becoming extinct beside Imoen and Sarevok. Slowly with each bhaalspawn dead, you become the last standing one, the most powerful and fearsome.~
@7015  = ~I wish they had no aims to kill me but I can't undo what happened.~
@7016  = ~Still mourning for them? Blast it <CHARNAME>, when will you start thinking for yourself only?~
@7017  = ~Anyway, let's find some more bhaalspawn to slay. Except you of course, I will save you to last for ...other reasons.~
@7018  = ~I am not an exotic animal becoming extinct. Choose your words wisely.~
@7019  = ~Woah, I did not expect such a thing from you, <CHARNAME>. What is wrong with comparing your father's seed count?~
@7020  = ~Anyway, you did get offended from my words it seems. I did not want to anger you in the first place though. Let's move on.~
@7021  = ~We can both fix this "extinction" problem together, Lena. Why don't we have a child?~
@7022  = ~(angrily) Are you serious? I will never raise a damn crying, shitting and sucking baby of yours, never...~
@7023  = ~(calms down after a few seconds) I mean... I hate children, <CHARNAME>, I don't want to bother growing a child. It is not related to you. I apologize for my outburst.~
@7024  = ~Let's move on, <CHARNAME> before I break your heart.~
@7025  = ~Now that you mention, it becomes fun to slay other bhaalspawns. There is something that makes me feel good when they are dust.~
@7026  = ~I thought so, it is probably the taint that excites you. The way you look at them, the excitement of your actions, sudden outbursts even exhausted. The taint fuels your energy like an unlimited fountain.~
@7027  = ~No, the feeling is plain disgusting, something unstoppable trying to take control of me and I don't like it.~
@7028  = ~You need to control yourself, fight the taint or whatever trying to control you. We need you at our side, actually we need to know your side.~
@7029  = ~Leave them to me if you prefer. I have no qualms slaying bhaalspawn or common weakling, I see no difference as they both spill blood.~
@7030  = ~You have seen him fighting, he could prove useful.~
@7031  = ~I agree, he is a potent warrior but what if he turns on you again? I will watch over him for some time just as precaution.~
@7032  = ~Instead of someone unknown, I would recruit my old foe.~
@7033  = ~I see your point but I still would not do because he is weaker than yourself as you killed him long ago. I have no qualms with him being your foe once but his actions might put you into trouble like your sister, Imoen.~
@7034  = ~Sibling or foe, if they are blocking my path, they will be dead.~
@7035  = ~Still same blood thirst... You will never change, would you. I hope you won't recruit any of your old foes like Bodhi or Irenicus, your party would become a hell of a revenge party.~
@7036  = ~I am bored of them too but they will cause nuisances in the future if I don't do anything now.~
@7037  = ~Yes, I agree on that. Better to cut when young before tree growing. Still there are others you let live.~

@7100  = ~Did you see Yaga Shura's bed? Huge piece of stone but with beautiful ornaments surrounding it. I would never have such a bed unless I decide to settle down.~
@7101  = ~I asked you this long ago but the circumstances were different. Now things are getting repetitive and boring considering what we have done.~
@7102  = ~Do you feel same or still excited to risk your neck for family issues?~
@7103  = ~Are you getting bored of me? If so, say it directly.~
@7104  = ~Idiot, I am not bored of you. I am bored of what you are doing, what others are forcing you doing.~
@7105  = ~I know what you feel and feel same but there is not much we can do. ~
@7106  = ~I would say to leave them alone but this time it is different. They are after us unlike other times. I know you hate leaving things undone and incomplete. I will come with you until all is over of course.~
@7107  = ~Let's rest for some time after all this bhaalspawn things are over. A short keep off from killing and slaying will make us miss those days. What do you think?~
@7108  = ~You changed Lena, you changed a lot.~
@7109  = ~Does asking for a rest change me? Bhaal's blood does not flow through my veins, my even very deep cut wounds do not heal within minutes. I can't transform myself into a demon of destruction whenever I want. Though that last thing happens randomly on me unlike yours. ~
@7110  = ~I take your answer as a "no". It is perfectly fine, I can keep pestering you for such a rest continuously then.~
@7111  = ~Only a short rest, yes. I don't want to get lost for a long time.~
@7112  = ~Yes, a short holiday only. After a week or two we can go on walking our paths again. I cannot keep myself from my blade anyway.~
@7113  = ~Now that I got confirmation from you, I need to decide where to go. Bring me the maps, maybe we can go some far away city...~
@7114  = ~Actually I thought of settling down and retiring from adventuring.~
@7115  = ~This was not the thing in my mind. You will be bored with the lack of constant excitement and spilling blood of our enemies from adventures.~
@7116  = ~Just reconsider your decision; although I agree we need some rest, giving up is way too much. There is still much to do. Maybe you will change your idea later.~
@7117  = ~I am bored too but because of reasons. Slaying others have never been bored for me.~
@7118  = ~You are the one who is slaying anything moving and they call me the demon, hmpf. Unfortunately I look like a saint within your party.~

@7200  = ~Monks in these lands are very rare, Balthazar was one of them but very powerful. Although he had good skill, he was simply not enough for our party, actually you only were enough.~
@7201  = ~I did not ignore you when counting the monks, but you were always around me so your powers became so familiar. I don't think of you as an opponent anyway.~
@7202  = ~You have seen me kicking, tripping or punching my enemies in combat a lot of times; you also felt them personally. I still use such abilities against all kinds of our opponents. ~
@7203  = ~Long ago a monk I met in my homeland taught me such martial arts. At first I did not think it would be that useful but later on when I saw what he could do alone, I was shocked to see such techniques were possible. ~
@7204  = ~His usage of momentum, tripping large giants with a single kick or stunning powerful demons with one punch... He exploded a man's heart just with a punch, that man's heart exploded to outside. I asked, actually begged him to train me.~
@7205  = ~Why did not you become a monk then?~
@7206  = ~He became like my mother, unbearable piece of meat living for himself only. I started to feel like a tool only in his life. At that time I could not control my urges, my rage properly. It was one of the things that prevented me to become a monk. I was never fully able to control myself, focus on something for long.~
@7207  = ~His torture would not end even I tried to beat him, which I did but I admit use of dirty tricks. I could not win against him in a fair fight. After a quarrel between us, I could not control myself and killed him in the end.~
@7208  = ~Why did you tell me all these?~
@7209  = ~I have not seen a monk for such a long time and when we met those monks, they reminded me of him. Quite interesting, in my all battles I use the techniques he taught me and I don't remember him even once but meeting some real monks for the first time reminded me of him.~
@7210  = ~Anyway, let's continue before you start asking silly questions about him.~
@7211  = ~You will not do such a thing to me if I don't teach you to turn into Slayer right?~
@7212  = ~No, I won't, you don't need to be scared of me mister chicken slayer.~
@7213  = ~Do you feel regret now?~
@7214  = ~I felt regret because of my foolish actions but not for him. I could not foresaw the end and I was used in the end. That is what created hatred inside me, I guess.~
@7215  = ~I can do such things too, you don't even need to beg me to train you.~
@7216  = ~I am not curious like before, <CHARNAME>, it is too late for me. Also I would never become a good monk because of my nature.~
@7217  = ~If you beg me enough, I can teach you a few tricks also.~
@7218  = ~You know I would not do such a thing ever. Perhaps you need a few hits in the head to remind you such an easy thing.~
@7219  = ~Don't you remember his name?~
@7220  = ~I do but it is not important now. ~
@7221  = ~Let me make a guess, he is your ex, right?~
@7222  = ~Unlike what you think, no, he was just a random stranger who was good at killing others with bare hands. Do you feel jealous when I am speaking about a man or my past affairs are disturbing you?~
@7223  = ~That monk taught me the style of monks. How they are trained, how they kill or attack others, how to sustain hits... All of the training was going good but later things started to change in him. He was not the one when I met him first.~

@7303  = ~She was beautiful as you saw but don't overthink about this. You are the one I love.~
@7304  = ~She was beautiful, yes, but this does not allow you to hesitate killing an enemy who tried to kill you in the first place. ~
@7305  = ~Next time be careful; during your hesitation your opponent can stab and kill you catching unguarded.~
@7306  = ~I confess, she affected me a bit but don't be that jealous, Lena.~
@7307  = ~Not in the slightest, you are imagining things.~
@7308  = ~Fine, fine. I saw you hesitated four seconds before you deliver the final blow through her hearth but probably I counted wrong.~
@7309  = ~If you admit of being jealous of a now dead drow, I will confess what I felt really.~
@7310  = ~I am not jealous of a simple drow. Once we had our duel, you did not hesitate to swing your blade through me but you hesitated before you kill a drow who wanted to kill you in the first place.~
@7311  = ~(after a silence) I admit, alright, I admit but I don't want to hear your excuses. Now leave me alone...~
@7312  = ~No, just common Bhaalspawn ideas flowing through my brain.~
@7313  = ~Really? I thought of something else though, actually saw. Sendai, that drow you have slain. After her death you became a half zombie, unaware of your surroundings. I doubt if she did curse you with some weird magic.~
@7314  = ~Is it too obvious?~
@7315  = ~Yes, too much. I did not think of you a weak willed <PRO_RACE> who can be charmed with a simple glance. Sendai, that drow you have slain. After her death you became a half zombie, unaware of your surroundings. I doubt if she did curse you with some weird magic.~

@7403  = ~Probably I would do same thing though current circumstances shows it is a failure.~
@7404  = ~Yes, others, such as me, would laugh hard at your failure to resurrect self but instead spawn dozens of powerful creatures to bring havoc on earth.~
@7405  = ~If possible I would give my essences to some objects like scrolls or rings or other trinkets which can be collected and gathered.~
@7406  = ~I thought the same but gave up the idea because ancient things tend to be strong and for this reason prone to be corrupted. ~

My question depended on a condition which would never happen, there is no reason to fear from me or see me as a threat.~
@7505  = ~The reputation bring some useful advantages also, for example you could ask anything from the other weaklings with nothing in return. You could oppose a king or queen and still they might obey what you ask, fearing to lose what they already have.~

@7510  = ~I do want such things but not with my reputation. I want to oppose a king and slay him, show my combat abilities to everyone to be the exact one in bards' tales.~
@7511  = ~I think you want to make the reputation with yourself, not with exaggerated tales from ear to ear. Maybe it is a better idea to let others live your reputation fresh.~
@7512  = ~Unfortunately I want to use the reputation we earned with our long lasted adventures. Leave me alone, now I have to think about what I should demand from others in towns for myself.~
@7513  = ~Not that I despise those actions, others' behaviors amuse me much more. Their approach for petty requests, fear in their eyes... This amuses me more.~

@7515  = ~If they are comparing you with a ruler of nine hells then I can't think of the reputation you would have.~
@7516  = ~True but seeing their hero slain would make me like a god in their eyes. Stupid weaklings, they like exaggerating such acts and events to very high levels.~
@7517  = ~Reputation does not matter when they are already scared of you.~

@7606  = ~Why don't we go to your world after these events are over?~
@7607  = ~We can do this but we need to find some mage to enchant your body to resist the cold temperature in my world. I don't want you freeze to death in the first night.~
@7608  = ~If you don't want, it is fine by me as long as you don't cast me aside.~
@7609  = ~Did you miss your world?~
@7610  = ~Not entirely, some of the basic concepts in my world are way more useful and meaningful than your world like respect for law and righteousness. Reversely your world is much more safer when you are trying to keep self away from all other things.~
@7611  = ~I have no plan of returning soon but we never know what may happen in future. Let's wait and see how things go.~
@7612  = ~Revenge?...~
@7613  = ~Exactly what I expected. Nevermind what I asked.~
@7614  = ~What is wrong for trying to get revenge?~
@7615  = ~Nothing but it is none of your business. If you think my first reason I asked to take you to my world, is revenge, then it has no meaning to press on this topic.~
@7616  = ~Let's move on, shall we? We can close this return to my world topic forever.~
@7617  = ~Did not you ask for this reason?~
@7618  = ~Yes, the question had a purpose but it had a meaning if your answer was not revenge. I would not ask such a thing to you for this reason and wanted to be sure you think like that or not.~
@7619  = ~Your answer made it clear things would be misunderstood so I request to close this return to my world topic forever.~
@7620  = ~Sure we can get your revenge after my issues are done.~
@7621  = ~No, I don't seek revenge. Things are long past now and it is none of your business. It was the last thing in my mind before I asked anyway.~
@7622  = ~Join your old group?...~
@7623  = ~No, never. I won't throw a sheep into wolf nest.~
@7624  = ~Who is the sheep here and why?~
@7625  = ~You are the sheep here of course. You know my story, they left me back to enemy long time ago and they might do the same to you if we join in the first chance. I won't accept such a thing.~
@7626  = ~We don't need to gamble to see if they will try such a thing. Also you don't have the courage and stomach to leave your party members behind when needed.~
@7627  = ~I asked you what you would feel about my reason because I don't want you to feel like I am using you to get my revenge. Revenge is the final thing in my mind about my world.~
@7628  = ~Let's move on, shall we?~
@7629  = ~Are you afraid to meet them again?~
@7630  = ~Afraid? No, but if I meet them again one of us won't live anymore in the end. I am not after revenge but also won't let them get away from my hands that easily even if it costs my life.~
@7631  = ~Don't you trust me, my potential?~
@7632  = ~I know what you are capable of but still you lack the courage and stomach to leave your party members behind. In the first solid chance they will do such a thing, I assure you.~
@7633  = ~They once left me behind and they will eventually do the same to you but I won't accept such a thing. I don't want to test your cruelty and their incompetence.~
@7634  = ~Boredom?~
@7635  = ~I agree there are times your world is much more fun but in general my world is better if you are looking forward slaying others for simple reasons or fun.~
